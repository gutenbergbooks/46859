</div>
<p class='c010' ><span class='small'>“Great minds are bravely eccentric; they scorn the beaten track.”—<span class='sc'>Goldsmith.</span></span></p>
<p class='c010' >In the city of Tours, in whose gabled streets
there lingers still some memory of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle
Impéria, Honoré de Balzac</span> was born on the
20th of May, 1799.</p>

<p class='c011' >His childhood was in no wise extraordinary,
save for the avidity with which he read the
Bible and the keen delight which he took in
the possession of a little red violin. He was
indifferent to romps and games, and when
not lost in the mysterious depths of the Scriptures
he played by the hour on his fiddle, and
extracted therefrom an enjoyment which was
almost sensual in its intensity. His parents
were well-considered people, in easy circumstances.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honoré</span> was their first-born, and to
him were subsequently given two sisters and a
brother, concerning whom only a passing mention
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
need be made. His eldest sister, Laure,
became the wife of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Surville</span>, a civil engineer,
survived her illustrious brother, and published
his letters, together with a weak sketch
of his life; his second sister also married, but
died at an early age; while his brother Henri
sought his fortune, after the manner of younger
sons, in the colonies, failed to find it, and was
otherwise entirely uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c011' >At the age of eight, Balzac was placed as
boarder at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Collége de Vendôme</span>, where,
through the compression of his dreamy nature
by unaccustomed tasks and rules, he soon
lapsed into a careless neglect of his duties, and
became, in consequence, one of the most frequently
punished pupils in his class. Favored,
however, by the tacit connivance of a tutor, he
passed most of his time in the library. Science,
philosophy, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</span>, religion, history, and
even dictionaries, he read and inwardly digested,
and during the six years that he remained at
the school he assimilated the substance of all
the books worth reading.</p>

<p class='c011' >This absorption of ideas produced a noteworthy
effect. His eye embraced six or eight
lines at a time, and his mind appropriated the
thought with a velocity equal to his glance; a
single word in a phrase often sufficing for a
clear understanding of the whole.</p>

<p class='c011' >His memory was like a vise. He remembered
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
not only the ideas which he had acquired
in reading, but also those which conversation
and reflection had suggested. Words, names,
figures, and places he not only recalled at will,
but he saw them within himself, brilliant and
colored as they were at the moment when he
had first perceived them.</p>

<p class='c011' >Mentally fortified by his extensive reading,
he wrote at the age of twelve the famous
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de la Volonté</span>,” so often mentioned in
his later works, but which was confiscated by
the regent as the probable cause of his neglect
of the regular curriculum, and which Balzac
says he doubtless sold for waste paper without
recognizing the value of the scientific treasures
whose germs were thus wasted in ignorant
hands.</p>

<p class='c011' >After this loss, more than terrible to a young
imagination, Balzac sought consolation in verse,
and wrote a poem on the Incas, commencing:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">O Inca! roi infortuné et malheureux!</span>” which,
with the exception of his subsequent “Cromwell,”
was his sole familiarity with the peplum
of the Muse; for, of the four sonnets in the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Illusions Perdues,</span>” the first and second are
by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lassaily,</span> the third is by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Girardin,</span>
and the fourth by Gautier, while the poem
in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Modeste Mignon</span>” was the work of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gérard
de Nerval.</span></p>

<p class='c011' >From these secret and laborious studies, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
well as from possible fermentation of ideas,
Balzac fell into a sort of coma and nervous
fever, which was singularly inexplicable to his
masters and teachers. His parents were hastily
summoned, and the precocious boy, now
almost epileptic, was taken home, where rest
and quiet gradually calmed the tumult in his
brain, and restored the health and vivacity of
boyhood. Little by little the results of his extraordinary
labors became classified within his
troubled mind, and to them were added other
ideas of a less abstract nature; and in wandering
on the banks of the Loire, or in attending
the impressive ceremonies at the Cathedral of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saint-Gatien,</span> he acquired not only a love of
the beautiful, but also the sincere and abiding
faith in religion with which he subsequently enriched
the pages of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine.</span>”
At home, as at school, however, his intelligence
was entirely unsuspected, and his sister,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Surville,</span> relates that whenever he
chanced to make a brilliant remark his mother
would invariably say, “It is impossible, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honoré,</span>
for you to understand what you are talking
about;” whereupon <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honoré</span> would laugh,
without deigning to enter into any explanations.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
His father, however, who was an inoffensive
disciple of both Montaigne and Swift,
had his own reasons for thinking well of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
son, and decided that a child of his could never
by any chance be a fool; and while at that time
he saw nothing in the boy which promised any
immediate celebrity, he nevertheless cherished
a few vague hopes.</p>

<p class='c011' >But the prescience which the father lacked
had already visited the son. From time to
time he stated that he would some day be famous,
and this boast appeared so outrageously
insulting to his brother and sisters that they
punished him with every torture which childish
ingenuity could invent.</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac’s family soon after moved to Paris,
where he again was placed at school. There,
as at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vendôme,</span> he gave no sign of future genius,
and as before was regarded as an idler
and a dullard.</p>

<p class='c011' >His classes completed, he attended the lectures
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guizot, Cousin,</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villemain,</span> and his
degree of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bachelier-ès-lettres</span> obtained, he entered
a law office which Scribe had just quitted.
Here he acquired that luminous insight
to law and procedure which served him to
such advantage in the varied litigations of his
future world, and enabled him, years after,
to plead, as Voltaire did for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Calas,</span> in defense
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sébastien Peytel,</span> a former acquaintance, accused
of the murder of his wife and servant.
The case was lost, and his client convicted; but
his oration was none the less superb, and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
argument is still cited as one of the most brilliant
efforts in the annals of the French bar.</p>

<p class='c011' >His legal apprenticeship completed, it was
naturally expected that he would follow the law
as a profession, but Balzac had other ideas; he
felt as did <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corneille</span> <em>e tutti quanti</em>, that his vocation
was not such as is found in courts, and
expressed a preference for a purely literary life.</p>

<p class='c011' >“But,” objected his father, “do you not
know that in literature, to avoid being a slave,
you must be a king?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Very well,” Balzac replied, “king I will be.”</p>

<p class='c011' >After many arguments it was finally agreed
that he should be allowed two years of probation;
and as his family were about to return to
the country, he was lodged in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue Lesdiguières,</span>
near the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal,</span>
on an allowance of a hundred francs a month.
His life there he has in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Facino Cane</span>” described
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I passed my days at the neighboring library.
I lived frugally, for I had accepted all the conditions
of that monastic life which is so necessary
to students and thinkers. I seldom went
out, and when I did a simple promenade was
converted into a source of study, for I observed
the customs of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faubourg,</span> its inhabitants
and their characters. As badly dressed as the
workmen and as careless of decorum, I attracted
no attention from them, and was enabled
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
to mix among them and watch their bargains
and disputes.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Observation had become to me intuitive.
It penetrated the spirit without neglecting the
body, or rather it seized exterior details so
clearly that it immediately went beyond them.
It gave me the power of living the life of any
individual upon whom it was exercised, and
permitted me to substitute my personality for
his, as did the dervish in the ‘Thousand and
One Nights’ who had the power of occupying
the body and soul of those over whom he pronounced
certain words. When, therefore, between
eleven and twelve at night, I encountered
a workman and his wife returning from the
theatre, I amused myself in following them
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard du Pont-aux-Choux</span> to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard Beaumarchais.</span> At first they would
speak of the play which they had just witnessed.
From that they would begin to talk of their
own affairs, the mother dragging her child after
her, listening neither to its complaints nor to
its demands. The money which was to be
paid to them was added, and then spent in
twenty different ways. Then came the household
details, murmurings on the excessive price
of potatoes, the length of the winter, energetic
discussions on the baker’s bill, and finally little
quarrels, in which they displayed their characters
in picturesque words. While listening to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
them I espoused their life. I felt their rags on
my back; my feet marched in their tattered
shoes; their desires, their needs, all passed into
my spirit, and mine into theirs: it was the dream
of a waking man. With them I grew angry at
their tyrannical masters or at their customers
who made them come again and again without
paying what they owed.</p>

<p class='c011' >“To relinquish my identity, to become another
through the intoxication of the moral
faculties, and to play this game at will, such
was my sole distraction. I have sometimes
wondered if this gift was one of those faculties
whose abuse leads to madness, but its causes
I have never sought. I know, merely, that I
possess and make use of it.”</p>

<p class='c011' >This ability to penetrate mentally the individuality
of another is the evident explanation
of the minuteness with which all of Balzac’s
characters are drawn, as well as the secret of
their logical attitudes; for as in every-day life,
while it is a question whether man is his own
providence or is interwoven in a web of pre-ordained
circumstances, yet in either case certain
results are inevitable and a matter of statistic,
so in Balzac there is no dodging of fate
or shirking of consequences, and he is careful,
in sending his own blood tingling through the
veins of his creations, to surround them with
the same laws to which he is himself subjected.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
During his novitiate Balzac prepared a five-act
tragedy in blank verse, entitled “Cromwell,”
a subject which it is curious to note was
simultaneously chosen by Victor Hugo. At
its completion, a professor of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">École Polytechnique</span>
was requested to decide whether the
lines contained a sufficient promise of genius
to warrant a further pursuit of literary honors
on the part of the young aspirant. The play,
conscientiously examined, was deemed simply
detestable, and the referee adjudged that Balzac
might do what he would, but that literature was
certainly not his vocation.</p>

<p class='c011' >From this decision there was no present appeal;
and while his mother and sisters begged
him to engage in some other occupation, his
father assured him that he would suppress his
allowance should he persist in his intentions.
Another perhaps would have yielded, but his
pride and belief in his destiny made his resolution
unalterable, and Balzac was left in solitary
sadness to meditate on the coquetries of
the Muse.</p>

<p class='c011' >“I delighted,” he says in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Peau de Chagrin,</span>”
“in the thought that I should live in the
midst of tumultuous Paris in an inaccessible
sphere of work and silence, in a world of my
own, of books and ideas, where like the chrysalis
I should build a tomb only to emerge again
brilliant and famous.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
“I took the chances of dying to live. In reducing
existence to its actual needs, I found
that three sous for <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charcuterie</span></i> prevented me
from dying of hunger and preserved my mind
in a state of singular lucidity, while enabling
me at the same time to observe the wonderful
effects which diet produces on the imagination.
My lodging cost three sous a day, I
burned at night three sous’ worth of oil, and for
two sous more I heated my room with charcoal:
and in this manner I lived in my aerial
sepulchre, working night and day with such
pleasure that study seemed the most beautiful
theme, the happiest solution, of existence. The
calm and silence necessary to the student
possess an indescribable something which is as
sweet and intoxicating as love, and study itself
seems to lend a sort of magic to all that
surrounds us. The forlorn desk on which I
wrote, my piano, my bed, my chair, the zigzags
of the wall-paper,—all these things became as
though animated and humble friends, the silent
accomplices of my future. Many a time I have
communicated my soul to them in a glance,
and often in looking at the broken moulding
I encountered new developments of thought,
some striking proof of my system, or words
which I considered peculiarly fitted to express
ideas almost untranslatable.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac had not as yet any settled plan of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
work, but he tried his hand, while forming his
style, at a quantity of comic operas, dramas,
comedies, and romances, none of which, however,
were accepted save by the gutter’s sneering
fatalist, the ragpicker.</p>

<p class='c011' >After many fruitless attempts and knocks at
many a door, Balzac succeeded at last in finding
a publisher, but of a type seen only in
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">opéra bouffe,</span> who proffered in payment of a
romance a promissory note with a year to run.
Balzac of course had no choice. He wished
to appear in print. The bargain was concluded,
and the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Héritière de Birague</span>” was produced.
Then, under various pseudonyms, such as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lord
R’hoone,</span> the anagram of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honoré, Dom Rago,
M. de Viellerglé,</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Horace de Saint-Aubin,</span>
he produced a quantity of novels somewhat
after the style of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pegault Lebrun,</span> and yet so
diverse in treatment that one of them, “Wann-Chlore,”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
was attributed to a luminary of the
Romantic school, and another, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annette et le
Criminel,</span>” was suppressed by the censorship.
Some of these books, whose paternity he always
denied, have since been collected under
the title of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Œuvres de Jeunesse,</span>” but of the
greater part no trace remains.</p>

<p class='c011' >Exhausted by privations and worn with continued
study, Balzac was obliged to return to
his family, then established at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeparisis,</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
where, broken in mind and health, he sank into
an almost hopeless dejection.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is this what you term life,” he wrote<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> to
his sister,—“this involuntary rotation and perpetual
return of the same things? I am in the
springtide of a flowerless life, and I long to
have some charm thrown over my chill existence;
for of what use is fortune and pleasure
when youth is gone? Of what use is the actor’s
gown if he play no longer his part? Old
age is a man who has dined and looks at others
eat; and I, I am young, and I hunger before
an empty plate—Laura, Laura, shall I, then,
never realize my two immense desires, to be
celebrated and to be loved?”</p>

<p class='c011' >But Balzac soon wearied of this plaintive inactivity,
and, fertile in projects, conceived the
plan of printing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Molière</span> complete in one volume,
and of following it with similar editions
of the French classics. When these had appeared,
he proposed, like Richardson, to produce
his own works, and his illuminous imagination
immediately foresaw new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Clarissas</span>
issuing from the press.</p>

<p class='c011' >The necessary working capital he procured
from his family, who, though far from rich,
were none the less glad to aid him in an enterprise
for which literature would be abandoned
and a legitimate business adopted.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
But after the publication of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Molière</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Fontaine,</span> in each of which he inserted an elaborate
and original introduction, he was obliged,
through the cabals of the other publishers, to
relinquish his plan, while burdened at the same
time with a load of debt which oppressed almost
every hour of his after life.</p>

<p class='c011' >He was now absolutely without resources.
The expense of a few sous attending the carriage
of a letter, an omnibus ride, anything, in
fact, which demanded the outlay of ready
money, he was obliged to forego, and even remained
in his garret that he might preserve
as long as possible the only shoes which he
owned.</p>

<p class='c011' >“My sole possessions,” he wrote to his sister,
“are my books, which I cannot part with,
and my good taste, which unfortunately for the
rich cannot be bought. If I were in prison I
should be happier; life then would cost me
nothing, and in any event I could not be more
of a captive than I am.”</p>

<p class='c011' >But the pecuniary loss which he had sustained,
and which amounted to about 120,000
francs, served but as a stimulus to renewed activity;
and resolving that he would recover from
the printing press all that it had robbed him of,
he commenced to seek some undiscovered vein
of literary treasure, and in 1829 brought out
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Dernier Chouan,</span>” the first romance which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
he considered worthy to bear his own name. Its
ferocity and passion attracted great attention,
and the public became at once favorably disposed
toward him; but when, a few months
later, the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Physiologie du Mariage</span>” appeared,
its success was not only instantaneous, but Balzac
was heralded as a new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Molière.</span> He now
emerged from quasi obscurity into the white
light of fame. Publishers were submissive,
praise was unstinted. He had realized the first
of his immense desires, and had it not been for
his weight of debt he might perhaps have been
able to realize the other, but his time was not
his own. He labored, if possible, more incessantly
than ever, conceived the plan of the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine,</span>” and from that time up to
almost the day of his death produced a series
of masterpieces which in point of interest and
erudition form the most gigantic monument in
the history of modern literature.</p>

<p class='c011' >His work accompanied him wherever he went.
He dreamed of it; he wrote while he ate; he
traveled over the better part of Europe, and
wrote while he traveled; he composed in the
omnibus and in the street; and had he had a
mistress he would, in all probability, have followed
the example of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baudelaire,</span> and composed
in her arms. Thoroughly conscientious, he
invariably visited the place where the scenes of
a drama were to be located. “I am going to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alençon,</span>” he would say; “you know <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mlle. Cormon</span><a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
lives there;” or, “I am off for Grenoble;
there is where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Benassis</span><a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> lives:” for it
should be remembered that not only were Balzac’s
characters as realistically vivid to him as
are the hallucinations of a neurosthene, but
he invariably spoke of them as another would
of friends and acquaintances. “Let us talk of
realities,” he one day said to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jules Sandeau,</span>
who had been speaking to him of an invalid relative,
“let us talk about ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie Grandet;</span>’”
and at another time, when his sister asked for
some information about Captain Jordy,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Balzac
replied very simply, “I never knew the man
before he came to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nemours,</span> but if he interests
you, I will try to learn something of him.” It
was a long time before he was able to find a
suitable husband for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mlle. Camille Grandlieu,</span>
and rejected all who were suggested to him.
“They are not in the same set,” he would say.
“Chance alone can supply her with a husband,
and chance is a commodity which a novelist
should use but sparingly. Reality alone justifies
the improbable, and the probable alone is
permitted to us.” But <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mlle. de Grandlieu</span> was
not destined to braid St. Catherine’s tresses,
and afterwards, to Balzac’s great delight, found
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
a suitable husband in the person of the young
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de Restaud,</span><a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> who in spite of his mother’s
derelictions<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> was otherwise a very acceptable
suitor.</p>

<p class='c011' >After the place of his novel had been visited,
viewed from every aspect, the customs noted and
the localisms acquired, Balzac would return to
Paris, shut himself up in a garret,—the garret
has its poetry,—and for weeks and sometimes
months at a time he would not only disappear
entirely from view, but all trace of him would
be lost.</p>

<p class='c011' >At other times, he would lodge under an assumed
name, which he imparted only to his most
intimate friends. “My address,” he wrote to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Carraud</span> in 1834, “is always <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Veuve Durand, 13, Rue des Batailles;</span>” and in
1837, he wrote to Dablin, “To see the Widow
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Durand,</span> a name must be given. Yours is on
the list.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“The house,” Gautier wrote,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> “of the Widow
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Durand</span> was as well guarded as the Garden of
the Hesperides. Two or three passwords were
exacted, and that they might not become vulgarized
they were frequently changed. Among
others, I recall the following. On telling the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
janitor that the season for prunes had arrived,
the visitor was permitted to cross the threshold;
to the servant who prowled about the
head of the stairway, it was necessary to murmur
‘I bring laces from Belgium;’ and on assuring
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de chambre</span> that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Bertrand</span> was in excellent health, the visitor
was ushered into the great man’s presence.”</p>

<p class='c011' >It was in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue des Batailles</span> that the
famous boudoir of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fille aux Yeux d’Or</span>”
actually existed; and though its luxury would
not appear unusual to-day, it was, nevertheless,
a source of continual wonder to his Bohemian
friends, and his own description of it is not devoid
of interest:<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c011' >“One side of the boudoir formed a graceful
semicircle, while in the centre of the other,
which was perfectly square, there shone a mantel-piece
of marble and gold. The door, which
was concealed behind a rich portière of tapestry,
was directly in front of the window.</p>

<p class='c011' >“In the horseshoe was a Turkish divan, fifty
feet in circumference and as high as a bed.
The covering was of white cashmere tufted with
bows of black and lilac silk, which were disposed
as at the angles of a lozenge.</p>

<p class='c011' >“The back of this immense bed rose several
inches above a pile of cushions, which added to
the general effect by their coloring and artistic
arrangement.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
“The boudoir was hung with a red material,
over which was draped an Indian muslin fluted
like a Corinthian column by a piping alternately
hollow and round, and bordered at top
and bottom by a band of lilac embroidered
with black arabesques. Beneath the muslin the
red became pink, and this delicate shading was
repeated in the window curtains, which were of
Indian muslin lined with pink silk and ornamented
with a fringe of black and lilac.</p>

<p class='c011' >“At equal distances on the wall above the
divan were six sockets of silver-gilt, each of
which supported two candles, while from the
centre of the ceiling hung a highly polished
lustre of the same material.</p>

<p class='c011' >“The carpet was like a camel’s-hair shawl,
and seemed a mute reminder of the poetry of
Persia. The furniture was covered with white
cashmere relieved by lilac and black. The
clock and candelabras were of gold and marble.
The one table which the boudoir contained was
covered with white cashmere, while all about
were jardinières of white and red roses.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Behind the semicircle was a secret passage,
at one end of which was an iron cot and at the
other a desk; and here it was that Balzac, secure
from intrusion, worked and composed at
his ease.</p>

<p class='c011' >To return, however, to the Widow <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Durand.</span>
In 1838 he wrote to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Hanska,</span> the
lady who subsequently became his wife:—</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
“The Widow <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Durand</span> is dead. She was
killed by the contemptible conduct of the daily
papers, who have betrayed a secret which should
have been sacred to every man of honor.”</p>

<p class='c011' >After this misfortune Balzac installed himself
openly at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Jardies,</span> a country house which
he had built at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ville d’Avray,</span> and where he
was, as he expressed it, “like the lantern of
Demosthenes, and not, as every one else says,
of Diogenes;” but when, a year or two later,
he took up his residence in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue Basse,</span> at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passy</span> he surrounded himself with all his former
precautions, instituted a series of countersigns
which he changed weekly, and transformed
himself into “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Bri....</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >When guarded in this way from any intrusion,
Balzac would work from twelve to twenty-one
hours a day. His usual hours of sleep were
from six in the evening until midnight. Then
he would bathe, don the white robe of a Dominican
friar, poise a black skull cap on his
head, and, under the influence of coffee and
by the light of a dozen candles, would work
incessantly till he could work no more.</p>

<p class='c011' >His work completed, the lion would forsake
his den, and for an evening or two he would
be seen in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Loge Infernale</span> at the opera,
invariably carrying a massive cane whose head
glittered with jewels, and which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de
Girardin</span> was pleased to imagine rendered him
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
invisible at will;<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> or he would make brief apparitions
in the salons of the literati and nobility,
and then, suddenly, without a word of
warning, he would shut himself up as impenetrably
as before.</p>

<p class='c011' >His manner of writing was stamped with the
same eccentricity which characterized all his
habits. When a subject which he proposed to
treat had been well considered, he would cover
thirty or forty sheets with a scaffolding of ideas
and phrases, which he then sent off to the
printer, who returned them in columns wired
and centred on large placards. The work,
freed in this way from any personality and its
errors at once apparent, was then strengthened
and corrected. On a second reading the forty
pages grew to a hundred, two hundred on the
third, and so on, while on the proof-sheets
themselves new lines would start from the beginning,
the middle, or the end of a phrase; and
if the margins were insufficient, other sheets of
paper were pinned or glued to the placards,
which were again and again returned, corrected,
and reprinted, until the work was at last satisfactorily
completed.</p>

<p class='c011' >But perhaps the most graphic description
of Balzac’s manner of writing is the one contained
in an article by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Edouard Ourliac</span> in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
“Figaro” for the 15th of December, 1837, of
which the following is a free translation:—</p>
<div class='c013'>THE MISFORTUNES AND ADVENTURES OF CÉSAR BIROTTEAU BEFORE HIS BIRTH.</div>
<p class='c010' >Let us sing, drink, and embrace, like the
chorus in an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">opéra bouffe;</span> let us waft kisses
in the air and turn on our toes, as they do in
the ballet.</p>

<p class='c011' >Let us rejoice now that we may. The “Figaro,”
without appearing to have done so, has
conquered the elements, all the malefactors,
and every sublunary cataclysm.</p>

<p class='c011' >The “Figaro” has conquered <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">César Birotteau.</span></p>

<p class='c011' >Never did the angered gods, never did Juno,
Neptune, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rambuteau,</span> or the prefect of
the police, oppose against Jason, Theseus, or
the wayfarers of the capital, greater obstacles,
monsters, ruins, dragons, demolitions, than these
two unhappy octavos. We have them at last,
and we know their cost.</p>

<p class='c011' >The public will have but the trouble to read
them, though that should count as a pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011' >As to M. de Balzac, twenty days of labor,
two reams of paper, another masterpiece, that
counts as nothing.</p>

<p class='c011' >Whatever else it may be considered, it is at
least a typographical exploit and a worthy example
of literary and commercial heroism.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
Writer, publisher, and printer, all deserve the
praise of their countrymen.</p>

<p class='c011' >Posterity will gossip about the binders, and
our grand-nephews will regret that they do not
know the names of the apprentices.</p>

<p class='c011' >I regret it myself,—otherwise I would tell
them.</p>

<p class='c011' >The “Figaro” promised the book for the
15th of December, and M. de Balzac began it
on the 17th of November.</p>

<p class='c011' >M. de Balzac and the “Figaro” have the
singular habit of keeping their word.</p>

<p class='c011' >The printing-press was prepared, and pawed
the ground like an excited charger.</p>

<p class='c011' >M. de Balzac sent immediately two hundred
sheets, scribbled in five nights of fever.</p>

<p class='c011' >Every one knows how he writes. It was an
outline, a chaos, an apocalypse, a Hindu poem.</p>

<p class='c011' >The office paled. The time was short, the
writing unheard of. The monster was transformed
and translated as nearly as possible
into familiar signs. No one could make head
or tail of it. Back it went to the author. The
author sent back the first two proofs glued on
enormous placards.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was frightful, it was pitiful. From each
sign, from each printed word, shot a penstroke,
gleaming and gliding like a sky-rocket, and
bursting at the extremity in a luminous fire
of phrases, epithets, substantives, underlined,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
crossed, intermingled, erased, and superposed.
Its aspect was simply dazzling.</p>

<p class='c011' >Fancy four or five hundred arabesques of
this kind, interlacing, knotted together, climbing
and slipping from one margin to another
and from the bottom to the top.</p>

<p class='c011' >Fancy twelve geographical maps entangling
cities, rivers, and mountains in the same confusion,
a skein harassed by a cat, all the hieroglyphics
of the Pharonian dynasty, or twenty
fireworks exploding at once.</p>

<p class='c011' >The office then was far from gay. The typesetters
beat their breasts, the presses groaned,
the proof-readers tore their hair and the apprentices
became howling idiots. The most
intelligent recognized the Persian alphabet,
others the Madagascan, while one or two considered
them to be the symbolic characters of
Vishnu.</p>

<p class='c011' >They worked on chance and by the grace of
God.</p>

<p class='c011' >The next day M. de Balzac sent back two
pages of the purest Chinese. It was then the
1st of December. A generous typesetter offered
to blow out his brains. Then other
sheets were brought, written in the most legible
Siamese. Three compositors lost their sight
and the little French that they knew.</p>

<p class='c011' >The proofs were sent back seven consecutive
times; then, a few symptoms of excellent French
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
appeared, and there was even noticed a certain
connection between the phrases; but the day
was fast approaching, and we felt that the book
would never appear.</p>

<p class='c011' >Desolation was at its height, and it was at
this point that the work became further complicated
by an admirable concourse of calamities.</p>

<p class='c011' >At the time when haste was the greatest, the
miserable being who that night carried the
proof-sheets to M. de Balzac was waylaid and
robbed.</p>

<p class='c011' >M. de Balzac had had the forethought to establish
himself at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chaillot.</span> The miserable being
screamed and yelled. The bandits took to
their heels. One proof-sheet was found at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neuilly,</span> another in an orchard, a third descending
the Seine. It is certain that they were
thrown away only on account of their illegibility.
Misfortune has its advantages.</p>

<p class='c011' >The proofs were recovered, but the night was
lost. There were cries and gnashing of teeth.
The end was fast approaching. However, the
typesetters took courage and the workmen took
the bit in their teeth. The office galloped.
The compositors foamed at the mouth, the
presses ravened, the binders were on springs,
the apprentices danced with excitement, the
proof-reader shook like an epileptic, and the
foreman had convulsions. The office was a
cage of palsied lunatics.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
The work was again taken in hand, and M. de
Balzac and the “Figaro” have kept their word.</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">César Birotteau</span>” will see the light of day
on the 15th of December. We have it now,
and we hold it tight. The office is armed, insured,
and barricaded. Smoking is not permitted.
There are lightning-rods on the roof,
and mounted guards at the door.</p>

<p class='c011' >Every precaution has been taken against accidents
and the ardor of our subscribers.</p>

<p class='c011' >At this moment “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">César Birotteau</span>” is a work
in two volumes, an immense tableau, an entire
poem, composed, written, and corrected fifteen
times by M. de Balzac in twenty days, and deciphered,
disentangled, and reprinted fifteen
times in the same period. It may be added
that M. de Balzac kept forty other workmen
busy with something else at another office.</p>

<p class='c011' >We will not now consider the value of the
work.</p>

<p class='c011' >It may be everything, or but a masterpiece.</p>

<p class='c014' >The names of Balzac’s characters are all
taken from real life; for, like Dickens, his theory
was that names which were invented gave
no life to imaginary creations, and, as did the
English novelist, he gathered many of them
from the signboards in the street. His joy at
the discovery of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Matifat</span> was almost as great as
his delight in finding <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cardot.</span> He found the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
former in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de la Perle,</span> in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marais.</span> “I
can see him now,” he said; “he will have the
pallid face of a cat. But <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cardot</span> is different: he
will be dry as a bone, hasty and ill-tempered.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In 1840, Balzac proposed to write for the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue Parisienne</span>”—a periodical which, it
may be explained, appeared but three times, and
whose three numbers Balzac wrote entirely—the
story of a man of genius, who, used as a
tool by others, died through the ingratitude of
those whom he had raised to magnificent positions,
and who had then abandoned him to
poverty and want.</p>

<p class='c011' >Such a character needed a name proportioned
to his destiny; a name which explained
and announced him as clearly as the cannon-ball
announces the cannon; a name which
would be peculiarly his own, and would reflect
his face, his figure, his voice, his past, his future,
his genius, his passions, his misfortunes,
and his glory.</p>

<p class='c011' >But this supernatural alliance of man and
name was not immediately discoverable, and
Balzac, who had put into circulation as many
cognomens as are contained in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Almanach
de Gotha,</span>” expressed himself incapable of manufacturing
it. A name, he considered, could no
more be fabricated than could granite or marble.
They were all three the work of time and
revolutions. They made themselves.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
As a last and supreme resource, therefore,
he set out one day, in company with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Léon Gozlan,</span>
on a journey, in search of a baptismal signboard
for his hero; and from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Barrière de
l’Étoile</span> to the summits of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmartre</span> they
zigzagged across Paris, subjecting every name
they encountered to the closest scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c011' >Thousands of names were examined, analyzed,
and rejected, until at last <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gozlan,</span> utterly
worn out, refused to walk another step.</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac looked at him, it is to be supposed,
very much as Columbus looked at his mutinous
sailors, and by force of entreaties obtained,
not three days’ grace, but three streets
more.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the first two nothing was found, but at
the extremity of the third Balzac suddenly
changed color, and cried in a voice broken by
emotion,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“There, there! Read that name!”</p>

<p class='c011' >Above a narrow, oblong door, which opened
on a sombre courtyard, there hung a sign which
bore for device the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas.</span></p>

<p class='c011' >“Our journey is at an end!” Balzac exclaimed;
“it terminates in a blaze of glory.
The name of my hero shall be <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas. Marcas</span>
contains the philosopher, the statesman,
and the poet. I will call him <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Z. Marcas,</span> and
thereby add to his name a flame, a tiara, and a
star. Nothing could be better. I wonder, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
who this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas</span> is; surely some great
artist.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“He is a tailor,” Gozlan brutally replied;
“there is another sign of his in the courtyard.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac looked deeply chagrined.</p>

<p class='c011' >“No matter,” he said; “he merited a better
fate. If I seem annoyed, it is not that I am
lacking in respect for tailors in general, but
because his calling reminds me of certain debts
and a few protested notes.”</p>

<p class='c011' >A day or two later the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue Parisienne</span>”
appeared, and with it the story of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Z. Marcas,</span>
now forming part of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie
Politique</span>” and containing the following monograph:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“A certain harmony existed between the
man and the name. This Z. with which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas</span>
was preceded, which was to be seen on
the address of his letters, and with which he
always completed his signature,—this last letter
of the alphabet presented to the imagination
a something which was indescribably fatal.</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas!</span> Repeat over to yourself this name,
composed of two syllables: does it not seem to
contain a sinister significance? does it not seem
as though its owner were born to be martyred.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Though weird and wild, this name has
nevertheless the right to descend to posterity:
it is well composed, it is easily pronounced,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
and possesses the brevity required of famous
names. Is it not as soft as it is bizarre? but
does it not also seem unfinished?</p>

<p class='c011' >“I would not dare to affirm that destiny is
uninfluenced by a name, for between the deeds
of men and their names there are inexplicable
affinities and visible discords which at once
astonish and surprise. But this subject will
some day assuredly form part of the occult
sciences.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Does not the Z. present a thwarted and contradicted
appearance? does it not represent
the contingent and fantastic zigzags of a tormented
life? What ill wind can have blown on
this letter that in every language to which it is
admitted commands barely fifty words! <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas’</span>
Christian name was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Zépherin. Saint Zépherin</span>
is highly venerated in Brittany. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas</span>
was a Breton.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Examine the name again. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Z. Marcas!</span> The
entire existence of the man is contained in the
fantastic assemblage of these seven letters.
Seven!—the most significant of the cabalistic
numbers. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas</span> died at the age of thirty-five;
his life therefore was composed of but
seven lustres. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas!</span> Does not the sound
bring to you the idea of something precious,
broken in a noiseless fall?”</p>

<p class='c011' >The fatality which Balzac conceived as attaching
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcas</span> was by no means limited to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
this imaginary creation. It followed him into
real life, and was at one time a source of such
serious preoccupation that he stood one evening
for two hours in the square of the Château
d’Eau confidently awaiting some fortunate occurrence,
and like Gautier in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle de
Maupin</span>” he awoke on certain days in a state
of great agitation, trembling at every noise, and
convinced that the happiness of his life was
somehow at stake.</p>

<p class='c011' >These extraordinary sensations naturally led
to a belief in the supernatural; and as his
mother, who was also interested in the abnormal,
was acquainted with all the celebrated
mesmerists and mediums of the day, he was
readily furnished with opportunities of experimenting
in magnetism and clairvoyance. His
charming story of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ursule Mirouët</span>” unquestionably
proves that he subsequently became
a firm believer in that occult electricity which
is variously known as the Theopœa of the ancients,
the Akâsa of the modern Hindu, and
the psychic force of Sergeant Cox; while his
account of the soul-projection of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Séraphita</span>”
is vivid enough to satisfy the most exacting
hierophant, and would have passed him,
initiate, into the brotherhood of the Theosophists.</p>

<p class='c011' >But perhaps the most curious evidence of his
every-day faith in divination is that contained
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
in the two following extracts from his correspondence:—</p>
<div class='c013'>TO M. CHAPELAIN, PHYSICIAN.</div>
<div class='c015'><span class='sc'>Paris</span>, <i>May, 1832</i>.</div>

<p class='c011' ><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I am attracted by the power of somnambulism,
and wonder why you have not
sought to obtain from some lucid subject the
causes of this disaster.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011' >Science is interested therein, and its discovery
would be an eternal honor to us.</p>

<p class='c011' >Had I not been ill for a week past I would
have ascended to the honors of practice, and
endeavored to convince myself whether the
power of a somnambulist was limited or infinite.</p>
<p class='c014' >The second extract is from a letter addressed
to his mother a year later:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I send you herewith two pieces of flannel
which I have worn on the body. Take them to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Chapelain,</span> and when he has examined the
first, ask of him the cause and position of the
malady<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and how it should be treated. See
that everything is clearly explained. Then
with the second piece ask the why and wherefore
of the blister ordered in the precedent
consultation.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
“Be careful to keep the flannels well wrapped
up, that the emanations may not be disturbed.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac’s hatred of journalists was intense,
and from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sainte-Beuve</span> down to the most insignificant
penny-a-liner all were enveloped in
the same superb contempt.</p>

<p class='c011' >No branch of the profession was exempt
from this antipathy, and critics and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuilletonistes</span></i>
shared alike in his wholesale condemnation:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“They want my scalp, do they, these Mohicans
of the press! Bah! I will drink out of
their skulls.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Drink he did, indeed, and long delicious
draughts, at that; and in picking up with the
point of his pen the venality, envy, and petty
spites of the trade, he drew in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Illusions
Perdues,</span>” in which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jules Janin</span> figures in the
transparent disguise of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Étienne Lousteau,</span> a
picture of journalism which was as faithfully
unpleasant as it was pitying and contemptuous.
In this respect, however, it is well to state that
no one was as indifferent to the opinion of the
press as Balzac himself. He rarely, if ever,
read the criticisms on his books, and left them,
in the consciousness of their worth, to find their
level unaided.</p>

<p class='c011' >One of the causes of his disdain of everything
which smacked of journalism was this:
He had engaged to write “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Séraphita</span>” for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes,</span>” and shortly after
the story had been delivered he learned that it
was published at St. Petersburg. Thinking, as
was but natural, that the editor had been the
victim of some audacious theft, he hastened to
tell him what he had heard; and his astonishment
may be readily imagined when he was
informed that the Russian edition had appeared
with the sanction of the editor himself,
who not only insisted that he had a perfect
right to do as he pleased with the manuscript,
but positively refused to make any indemnity.
Thereupon, Balzac, in spite of the remonstrances
of his friends, who pointed out that
any contest with the “Revue,” whose word was
law, would inevitably result in the closing of
its columns to him, began a lawsuit, alleging
that, independent of the pecuniary loss which
he suffered, a precedent of this kind, once established,
would in the future be highly prejudicial,
not only to him, but to all his confrères.
Much to his amazement, however, the defendant
appeared in court with a list of signatures
of almost all of those whom he had sought to
defend at his own risk and peril, who attested
that from a literary as well as from an ethical
standpoint they considered the action of the
editor of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</span>” as
eminently right and proper.</p>

<p class='c011' >The law was, none the less, perfectly clear.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
Balzac won the suit, and with it a host of enemies,
whose hatred was so vigorous that it
barely abated, even after his death. Their insults
delighted him. “Fire away,” he would
say; “the armor is strong. Your abuse is an
advertisement; your praise would lull the public
to sleep, but your diatribes wake them up.
Besides, you hit the mark sometimes, and every
fault you signalize I correct, which in the end is
so much gained.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Among the host of enemies thus aroused
were those who, not content with denying his
genius, advanced their artillery into private
life, and painted him in the possession of every
vice in the criminal statutes; and it is from the
falsehoods of these guerrilleros that all the stupidities
which have been told concerning him
found their primal gestation. Not only his morality,
his honesty, his sobriety, were attacked,
but even his name was denied to him. The <em>de</em>
was declared not only an affectation, but a
theft; and when some one said to him, in allusion
thereto, “But you are no connection of the
De Balzac d’Entragues,” “Ah! am I not?” he
answered placidly. “Well, then, so much the
worse for them.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c010' ><span class='small'>“One would say he had read the inscription on the gates of Busyrane,—‘Be
bold;’ and on the second gate,—‘Be bold, be bold,
and evermore be bold;’ and then again had paused well at the third
gate,—‘Be not too bold.’”—<span class='sc'>Emerson</span>, <i>Plato.</i></span></p>
<p class='c010' >The general plan and outline of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie
Humaine</span>” originated in a comparison between
humanity and animal existence. That
which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Buffon</span> had achieved in zoölogy, Balzac
proposed to accomplish in moral science, and
the habits and customs as well as the vices and
virtues of his contemporaries found in him a
secretary whose inventory offers to posterity
an elaborate insight into the every-day life of
France in the nineteenth century, and realizes
for their future curiosity that work which the
ancient monarchies have neglected to bequeath
to us as their own civilizations.</p>

<p class='c011' >But the pictures of two or three thousand of
the most striking figures of an epoch required,
in a general history of society, not only frames
but galleries, and the work therefore is divided
into,</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie Privée.</span></p>

<p class='c011' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie de Campagne.</span></p>

<p class='c011' >These six subdivisions are grouped under the
general title of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études de Mœurs,</span>” and in
them the attempt has been made to examine
and explain the general causes of earthly happiness
and misery, as demonstrated in the results
obtainable in the practice of the great
principles of order and mortality, or in the selfish
abandonment to purely personal interests.</p>

<p class='c011' >Happiness, Balzac considered, consisted in
the exercise of our faculties as applied to realities.
But inasmuch as its principles vary with
each latitude, and ideas of right and wrong find
their modifications in the climate, he concluded
that morals and convictions were valueless
terms, and that happiness was to be found, first,
in violent emotions which undermine existence;
second, in regular occupations functionating
like mechanism; or, lastly, in the study of the
laws of nature and in the application of the
lessons thereby derived.</p>

<p class='c011' >In his treatment of this subject he has prepared
a complete history of the effects of the
agitation of social existence, and each of the
foregoing divisions represents a particular aspect
of life.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
In the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie Privée,</span>” life is
represented between the last developments of
childhood and the first calculations of virility.
These scenes contain tableaux of the emotions
and undefined sensations combined with pictures
of the errors committed through ignorance
of the exigencies of the world.</p>

<p class='c011' >The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie de Province</span>” represents
that phase of existence in which passions,
calculations, and ideas take the place of
sensations, impulses, and illusions. The instincts
of the young man of twenty are generous;
at thirty he calculates and turns egotist.
These scenes therefore initiate the reader into
the thousand aspects of the transition through
which a man passes when abandoning the
thoughtless impulses of adolescence for the
politic attitudes of manhood. Life becomes
serious: positive interests jostle with violent
passions, disillusions begin, the social machinery
is revealed, and from the shock of moral
or pecuniary interests the crime bursts in the
midst of the most tranquil household.</p>

<p class='c011' >Herein are unveiled the petty annoyances
by whose periodicity a poignant interest is concentrated
in the slightest detail of existence.
Herein are also exposed the petty rivalries, the
jealousies born of vicinage, and the family
worries, whose increasing force degrades and
weakens the most resolute will. The charm of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
dreams escapes; the prosaic and the matter of
fact alone exist; woman reasons, and no longer
feels; she calculates where before she gave.
Life is now ripened and shaded.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie Parisienne</span>” the
questions are enlarged, and existence painted
in bold outlines gradually arrives at the frontiers
of decrepitude. Herein purity of sentiment
is exceptional: it is broken in the play of
interests and scattered by the mechanism of
the world. Virtue is calumniated, innocence is
purchased. Passions become vices, emotions
ruinous gratifications; everything is analyzed,
bought, and sold. Life is a bazaar; humanity
has but two forms, that of the deceiver and the
deceived; it is a struggle and a combat, and
the victor is he who best throttles society and
moulds it to his own ends. The death of relatives
is awaited; the honest man is a simpleton;
generosity is a means, religion a governmental
necessity, probity a policy; everything
is marketable; absurdity is an advertisement,
ridicule a passport, and youth, which has lived
a hundred years, insults old age.</p>

<p class='c011' >These scenes close the tableaux of individual
existence, and their three frameworks contain
representations of youth, manhood, and old age.
First the bloom of life, the expansion of the
soul, and the radiance of love; then come the
calculations, the transformation of affection
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
into passion; and, lastly, the accumulation of
interests and the continual satisfaction of the
senses joined to the inevitable weariness of
mind and body.</p>

<p class='c011' >Nothing but that which affects the individual
proper has herein been treated, and the fragments
of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie Politique</span>” express,
in consequence, a wider range of thought.
In these pages the actors represent the interest
of the masses, and place themselves above
those laws to which the types in the preceding
series were subjected. The foregoing divisions
described the constant antagonism of thought
and sentiment, but in these scenes thought is
an organizing force and sentiment is completely
abolished. They are, however, incomplete, as
are also the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie Militaire,</span>” in
which Balzac proposed to represent the action
as taking place, not in an apartment, but on
the battle-field; not in the struggle of man with
man, but in the concussion of France and Europe,
in the slaughter of the conquered and the
pæans of the victors.</p>

<p class='c011' >After these pages, whose completion was prevented
by his sudden death, the calm and peaceful
pictures of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scènes de la Vie de Campagne</span>”
follow in orderly sequence. They
represent rest after exertion, landscapes after
interiors, the hush of the country after the uproar
of the city, the cicatrice after the wound.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
This last division contains the same interests
and the same struggles, but weakened now by
lack of contact, like passions grown dull in solitude.
It is the twilight of a busy day, a summer
evening solemn with sombre shadows. It
contains the purest characters and the application
of the great principles of order, morality,
and religion, and its actors, worn with the fatigues
of the world, mingle complacently with
the innocence of childhood.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011' >Thus completed, the entire work has its
geography and its own genealogy, its localities
and their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concomitants,</span> its personages and
their deeds. It has its own armorial, its nobility
and middle class, its artisans, its peasants,
and its army. It is a world in itself. But
its most striking feature is the admirable unity
preserved throughout; and this unity is undoubtedly
due to a suggestion derived from
the works of Sir Walter Scott, whom Balzac
considered as a gifted sculptor who chiseled
magnificent figures and draped them with genius
and sublimity, but, while presenting the
seductive effects of a marvelous analysis, left
them lacking in synthesis and totally unrelated.</p>

<p class='c011' >“The Waverley Novels,” he said,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> “resemble
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Musée de la Rue des Petits-Augustins,</span> in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
which each object, while magnificent in design,
relates but to itself. Genius is complete
only when to the faculty of creating it joins
the power of coördinating its creations. The
gifts of observation and description are in
themselves insufficient; they must tend to a
certain result. The Scotch bard was possessed
of too clear a vision not to have understood
this axiom, but its understanding assuredly
came too late.” To this reflection the unity of
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine</span>” is probably due; and
that it may not be objected that certain of its
passages are unrelated to the others, it is well
to note that Balzac died too suddenly to be able
to connect the broken threads, which in any
event are but few and far between.</p>

<p class='c011' >But the task of rendering his work at once
interesting and instructive was one of much
greater difficulty than that of Scott’s, who drew
his characters from former days, when every
class of society was clearly defined, and clothed
them from a wardrobe opulent with historical
effects; whereas Balzac was obliged to offer in
clear relief the almost imperceptible differences
of the types of yesterday and to-day, that
through an equality of fortune and education
have destroyed the contrasts which once existed
between the different degrees of the social
order. Aided, however, by that peculiar intuition
which never forsook him, he chose from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
among the physiognomies of his epoch an assortment
of those fugitive traits which are imperceptible
to the eyes of the vulgar; and in
scrutinizing face after face, attentive to the
changes of expression and inflections of voice,
he was enabled to present a series of individualities
which are far more realistic than those
of his illustrious predecessor.</p>

<p class='c011' >After displaying in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études de Mœurs</span>”
all the moral and physical transformations
through which mankind passes, and after describing
the social effects of their natural or
civil positions, Balzac sought in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études
Philosophiques</span>” to demonstrate the causes of
these effects; and while the first part of the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine</span>” contains but a series of
individualities typified in the treatment of his
subject, in the second part are to be found
the same types individualized: as, for example,
where in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études de Mœurs” Grandet</span> is
purely and simply a miser, avarice in the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études Philosophiques</span>” is incarnated in the
person of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maître Cornélius,</span> and the subject, like
a sponge, gains in weight what it loses in
breadth.</p>

<p class='c011' >The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études Philosophiques</span>” is the fruit
of analyzed comparisons of all the works which
the philosophers of antiquity and the specialists
of his day had produced on the intellect;
and starting with the famous axiom of Jean
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
Jacques Rousseau, that “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’homme qui pense
est un animal dépravé,</span>”—an idea which, as is
well known, found its poetic interpretation in
Byron’s “Manfred,” and its dramatic aspect in
the “Faust” of Goethe,—Balzac proceeds to
prove that ideas and sentiments are simply
dissolvents of a greater or less activity; and
taking as his premises the admitted fact that
instincts violently excited by factitious or fortuitous
circumstances produce unconsciousness
and even death, and also that thought, when
augmented by the transitory force of passion,
may become a poison or a dagger, he infers,
from the ravages produced by the intellect,
that thought is the most active agent in the
disorganization of man, and consequently of
society. “Consider,” he says in “Louis Lambert,”
“the difference between man who desires
nothing and lives like a plant for a hundred
years, and the creating artist who suffers early
death. Where the sun is, there is thought and
brevity of existence; where the cold is, there is
torpor and longevity.” Then, after considering
man as a simple organization, he brandishes the
proposition that vitality decreases in exact proportion
to the strength of desire and the dissipation
of thought, and leads the reader, therewith,
through the gradual development of his
theory, which is first attacked in “La Peau de
Chagrin.” This weird and fantastic production,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
in which skepticism and the supernatural join
hands, represents the ravages of thought and
the supreme expression of egotism as seared
by the hot iron of civilization.</p>

<p class='c011' >In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Recherche de l’Absolu,</span>” the theme
is continued, but viewed in a broader and more
comprehensive light. In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Peau de Chagrin,</span>”
the individual is destroyed by the force
of desire. In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Recherche de l’Absolu,</span>”
the pursuit of an idea annihilates an entire
family. The first is the world of pleasure, an
epoch in itself; the second is the world of science,
and glitters with brilliant hypotheses.
In both instances, an idea, gradually strengthened,
becomes a passion and a disorganizing
force. In “L’Adieu,” happiness, exalted to
the highest degree, becomes a destructive
agency. In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Réquisitionnaire”</span>, a mother
is killed by the violence of maternal affection.
In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">El Verdugo,</span>” a father is slain by his son
that a title may be preserved. In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Drame
au Bord de la Mer,</span>” a son is slain by his
father that an hereditary instinct may be destroyed.
In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maître Cornélius,</span>” avarice kills
the miser. In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Chef d’Œuvre Inconnu,</span>”
art kills the artist. In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gambara,</span>” the composer
is crazed by his own conceptions. In
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Enfant Maudit,</span>” terror is the destroyer, and
the subject treated herein finds a natural and
logical sequence in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auberge Rouge.</span>” In
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Proscrits,</span>” the sentiment of religion becomes
the destroyer, and in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Séraphita</span>” the
same idea is more vividly presented. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">César
Birotteau,</span>” an existence untroubled by misery,
is, through sudden good fortune, cut off as by
a scythe. In the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Église,</span>” the agent is incredulity,
but in “Louis Lambert” is to be
found the most severe deduction from the fundamental
proposition in that it represents the
thinker killed by thought.</p>

<p class='c011' >The destructive power of the mind and imagination,
from the Neronian conflagration to
the suicide of Castlereagh and Chatterton, the
aphasia of Emerson, and the insanity of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourgénieff,</span>
is too well known and too thoroughly
understood to need further commentary in
these pages; and in connection with this it
need but be said that, while the attraction of
gravity had been witnessed by countless generations,
as it remained to Newton to formulate
the obvious propositions of cause and effect, so
in this branch of mental science, whose results
have been patent since the beginning of history,
a Balzac was necessary for the full elucidation
of the subject, and for the proper presentation
of the conclusions derived from the
psycho-mental evidence of ages.</p>

<p class='c011' >After having, in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études de Mœurs,</span>”
described society in every aspect, and demonstrated
in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études Philosophiques</span>” all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
underlying causes of the general results, Balzac
proposed in the third and last division of the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine,</span>” namely, in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études
Analytiques,</span>” to examine the principles upon
which the first two rest.</p>

<p class='c011' >This last division, however, is one of the
few unfinished windows of his Aladdin’s palace,
for, out of the six volumes which it was to
contain, two only were written before death intervened.
These two works, the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Physiologie
du Mariage</span>” and the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petites Misères de
la Vie Conjugale,</span>” are a series of duos between
husband and wife, augmented at times by the
tenor notes of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amant.</span></i> The first is dedicated
to the reader, and contains the deceptions
of the husband; the second, those of the
wife. At once malicious and diabolically witty,
these two books are as delicately analytical as
the deductions of Leuwenhoeck and Swammerdam,
and abound with that peculiar though refreshing
condiment which is generally known
as Gallic salt.</p>

<p class='c011' >It is to be regretted that these two books,
the first of which was published at the outset
of the author’s career, and the second towards
the close of his life, were not strengthened and
augmented by the others with which he proposed
to accompany them, and whose subjects
and titles—namely, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anatomie des Corps
Enseignants,</span>” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pathologie de la Vie Sociale,</span>”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monographie de la Vertu,” “Dialogue Philosophique
et Politique sur la Perfection du
XIXe Siècle</span>”—have alone descended to us;
for this vein of literary treasure can never be
profitably worked save by another Balzac or a
modern Aristophanes.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was in 1844 that Balzac said, “The first
half of the present century will be found to
have been greatly influenced by four men,—Napoleon,
Cuvier, O’Connell, and myself. The
first lived on the blood of Europe, the second
espoused the globe, the third became the incarnation
of an entire race, while I shall have
carried a complete society in my brain.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Though almost another half century has now
elapsed since these words were uttered, it would
seem that the influence which he was then
conscious of exerting is even more vigorous
than before. The characters which he painted
formed, it is true, part of a Paris now dead and
forgotten, but the types have survived, and
the lessons which he deduced therefrom are
as eminently instructive now as they were in
the days when he wrote; and while, taking the
world at large as the groundwork of his edifice,
man was necessarily but the detail, he has, in
his description thereof, painted him in every
phase,—consequent and inconsequent, neither
completely good nor completely vicious, logical
at times, and sometimes great, but incessantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
opposing his own interests to the laws
of society in that gigantic struggle of customs
and sentiments which is as inconsistent to-day
as it was fifty years ago.</p>

<p class='c011' >When the “fiat lux” was pronounced, and
man completed, Balzac turned to his natural
companion, and in his portraiture of woman
not a single type is lacking. Herein he is unexcelled
and unsurpassable. That which Euripides
considered as the most terrible of all
misfortunes, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Maistre</span> nothing but a
beautiful animal, found its most graphic expression
through him. As a faithful naturalist,
he has, in descending the spiral of civilization,
described and classified the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">femina simplex</span></i>;
but the ideal woman, sublime in her errors,
magnificent in her devotion, and royal in her
forgiveness, has found her geographer in him.
His descriptions of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Beauséant,</span> the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse de Langeais, Madame Firmiani,</span> the
Countess in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Colonel Chabert,” Madame Claës,
Madame Jules, Madame de Montsauf, Béatrix,</span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle des Touches</span> comprise woman
almost in her entirety; they are landmarks in
psychological study; and so true to nature are
they that their appearance marked a new era
in literature.</p>

<p class='c011' >It is in these portraits that Balzac is most
realistic; and while a few of the most admirable
among them are sometimes erring, yet it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
will be admitted that womankind is not composed
exclusively of angels; perfection is often
dull, and a fault may be a virtue. By way of
contrast, however, he has, in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie Grandet,
Madame Firmiani, Madame de la Chanterie,
Marguerite Claës, Madame Jules, Agathe Rouget,
Pierrette, Madame Hulot,</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ursule Mirouët,</span>
not only solved the difficult problem of
rendering virtue interesting, but he has created
in frames of impeccable beauty a series of irreproachable
Madonnas.</p>

<p class='c011' >His revelation of woman is completed in a
special and parallel study of love. Love he considered
the mainspring of humanity; without it,
religion, history, romance, and art would be useless;
and he has analyzed, dissected, and explained
its every phase, hesitation, palpitation,
and tenderness.</p>

<p class='c011' >Beyond the scenic effects which he lent to
passion, Balzac entered thoroughly into the
specialties of trade and profession, and it seems
almost incredible that one mind could have grappled
with the details of the practice of law which
are so admirably described in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Contrat de
Mariage,</span>” in his portrait of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Derville</span> the lawyer,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peerquin</span> the notary, and the proceedings
in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">César Birotteau,</span>” while imagining such
types as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vautrin,</span> who dominated Paris from
the depths of the galleys, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Fille aux yeux
d’or</span> languishing in her octagonal boudoir.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
As <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bianchou</span> he is alienist and physician; in
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dr. Mirouët</span> he is medium and mesmerist; he is
a miser in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grandet</span> and discounter in Gobseck;
he is vicar at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tours</span> and old maid at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Issoudun.</span>
None better than he has described that class
of fascinating scoundrels of which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rastignac</span> is
the type, nor painted more clearly the heralds
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i> and philosophers of satiety than he
has done in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Marsay</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maxime de Trailles.</span>
In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Deux Poètes</span>” he is printer and manufacturer
of paper; in the “Cousin Pons” he
presents the flower of an imagination intoxicated
with the master paintings of great artists;
while in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Illusions Perdues</span>” the journalist
is dissected and the publisher decomposed.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the veins of his characters there is not a
drop of ink; they live, move, and have their
being, and their eyelashes are as delicately finished
as their epigrams.</p>

<p class='c011' >Starting from the mud and vermin of Parisian
by-ways, and ascending to the steps of the
throne, Balzac garnered every possible type, no
two of which are similar; each is original and
all are profoundly human; and while the dregs
of London are not further removed from the
splendors of Teheran than is mother <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nourrison</span>
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Grandlieu,</span> yet Balzac’s intuition
divined the one as clearly as he described
the other.</p>

<p class='c011' >In his transitions and contrasts, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
there is as little abruptness as there is in the
marriage of the blue of the skies with the green
of a landscape; changes follow in orderly and
natural sequence, and the mind of the reader is
only confused at the multiplicity of his attainments,
which present in turn houses and costumes,
interiors and countries, intermingled
with plot, science, religion, politics, agriculture,
erudition, mysticism, and wit.</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac was also a delicious landscape painter,
and his scenes from Brittany in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Chouans,</span>”
his landscapes of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Touraine</span> and particularly
that of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vouvay</span> in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Femme de Trente
Ans,</span>” the grand sketch of Norway in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Séraphita,</span>”
that of the Mediterranean island in
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Duchesse de Langeais,</span>” are cited by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Davin</span>
as masterpieces of graphic description.</p>

<p class='c011' >The resources of Balzac’s genius are perhaps
as clearly exhibited in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie Grandet</span>” as
in any of his other works, and the appearance
of this romance gave the keynote to the present
Realistic school. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie Grandet</span>” is the
conquest of absolute truth in art. It is the
drama applied to the most simple events of
life; the fusion of the trivial and the sublime,
the pathetic and the grotesque. It is a picture
of life as it is, and the model of what a
novel should be.</p>

<p class='c011' >The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">motif</span></i> here commenced is admirably continued
in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Curé de Tours,</span>” which contains
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
none of those elements heretofore considered
indispensable in the manufacture of fiction.
From these pages love and marriage are banished;
there is barely an event to be mentioned,
yet the dumb, tortuous struggle between the
two priests is at once clear cut and peculiarly
vivid. Herein the most humble trivialities of
the subject are elevated and dramatized, and to
attentive eyes this book will perhaps contain
the secret of Balzac’s superiority; for as no rôle
is poor to a good actor, Balzac in this story
demonstrates that nothing was small beneath
his pen.</p>

<p class='c011' >The interiors of Gerard Dow, with their vast
chimneys lit by flickering flames, their polished
floors, walls hung with tapestries, their sculptured
cornices and quaint and curious furniture,
their shadowed backgrounds and doors which
seem about to open upon some mysterious
room, are to be found in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Recherche de
l’Absolu,</span>” in which the opulent detail of the
Flemish school is equaled, if not surpassed.
Here, as in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie Grandet,</span>” the drama is
formed of the fusion of the trivial and the sublime,
and for the proper presentation of the subject
he extracted from the past of chemistry its
possibilities for the future.</p>

<p class='c011' >This work, as is the case with almost all his
others, contains evidence of the most obstinate
researches; and in this respect it may be noted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
that the majority of his books are the result of
patient labor and prolonged meditations.</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ursule Mirouët,</span>” one of his most chaste
conceptions, is the fruit of exhaustive experiments
in clairvoyance. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Séraphita</span>” was born
of the suggestions of a hundred works of the
mystics. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">César Birotteau</span>” is a text-book on
bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c011' >The production of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gambara</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Massimillia
Doni</span>” necessitated not only a thorough
musical schooling, but vast operatic knowledge,
and before attacking his subject Balzac engaged
a violinist to saturate him with Rossini.
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Grande Bretèche</span>” is the essence of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Causes Célèbres,</span> and dowered French literature
with a new shudder. The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Contrat de
Mariage</span>” is a code of legal <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse.</span></i></p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maître Cornélius,</span>” which with the exception
of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catherine de Médicis</span>” contains the
only ghosts that he has evoked from the night
of the past, is an attempt to rehabilitate Louis
XI., and to refute the historical portion of
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quentin Durward.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Deux Proscrits</span>” was the result of prolonged
meditations on the works of Dante,
while “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Dernière Incarnation de Vautrin</span>”
is a dictionary of prison slang.</p>

<p class='c011' >But the works for which he cared the most
and on which he expended the greatest amount
of labor were “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis Lambert</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Médecin
de Campagne.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
In “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis Lambert,</span>” he asks whether electricity
is not the basis of the particular fluid
from which ideas are derived, and proceeds
thereupon to consider thought as a complete
system similar to that of vegetation; and after
analyzing the birth, life, or death of certain
thoughts,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> he expresses the opinion that ideas
and sentiments are endowed with physical
properties, such as weight and movement; and
after fortifying it with striking examples of
expectation, fear, anger, and determination, he
concludes that facts do not exist, that ideas
alone endure, and that volition is a material
force, similar to that of steam.</p>

<p class='c011' >In spite of the amount of labor which a work
of this kind necessitated, a still greater amount
was expended on “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Médecin de Campagne,</span>”
of which every line and every phrase was
weighed, rewritten, and corrected again and
again. In this work he attempted to grasp the
simple beauty of the Scriptures, to surpass the
“Vicar of Wakefield,” and to put the “Imitation
of Christ” into action; but its pages were
written above the level of the ordinary reader,
and in spite of its profundity of thought it is
perhaps the least known of all his writings.</p>

<p class='c011' >The romance, however, which gained for him
the greatest favor in the boudoirs of Europe
was the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de Deux Jeunes Mariées,</span>”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
which is one of the few works in which happy
and satisfied love has been successfully depicted.
In Rousseau there was too much rhetoric,
in Richardson too much pretension; Scott
was hampered by English prudery, and is consequently
chill as an icicle; the poets as a rule
were too extravagant and too much engrossed
in metaphors; and it remained to Balzac to
describe the insensate fears and unreasoning
jealousies of that passion of which many speak,
but few have known.</p>

<p class='c011' >The masterful handling of these widely contrasting
subjects shows not only an equipment
of profound penetration and power of observation,
but also an erudition at once varied and
luminous. His works are those of an anatomist
from whom nothing escaped, a psychologist
from whom nothing was hidden, and a
realist who described all. Joined thereto was
the gift of adjective: in this he is the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Benvenuto
Cellini</span> of literature, for his words seem
less like symbols of speech than awakeners of
trains of thought.</p>

<p class='c011' >His originality is entirely undisputed. It
would not be a difficult task to point out the
buried hands which modeled the grandiose figure
of Hugo, and the tombs ransacked by
Shakespeare are still open to inspection; but
Balzac was totally without literary ancestry.
The influence of Scott and Hoffmann, at that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
time enormous, possibly presided at the conception
of some of his earlier works, and
brought to them strength from the massiveness
of the one and coloring from the unexpectedness
of the other; they were perhaps the transitory
models of a necessary apprenticeship, in
which the masters were soon to be neglected
and surpassed. Aside from this early schooling,
Balzac is indebted to no one,—neither to
the Greeks nor to the Romans, to the Italian
school, to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trouvères</span> of feudal France nor
to the Minnesingers of the Middle Ages; and
even where Hoffmann is not, he at least is entirely
modern and absolutely original; for the
fantastic effects of the former were drawn from
Micromegas, who had already extracted them
from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cyrano de Bergerac,</span>—a well into which,
it may be noted, Voltaire himself has dipped;
and in this respect, that it may not be objected
that the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Contes Drolatiques</span>” are but a continuation
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rabelais, Béroalde de Verville,</span> and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Reine de Navarre,</span> it is well to point out
that where but the female was seen by these
writers Balzac discovered the woman, a difference
surely as great as between the bottle and
the wine.</p>

<p class='c011' >And here perhaps a word may be said in regard
to the present Realistic school, of which
he was the founder, and whose influence is
daily becoming more noticeable and apparent.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
The term <em>present</em> Realistic school is used advisedly;
for though it was only about twenty-five
or thirty years ago that realism began to be
seriously considered, it is erroneous to suppose
that it is of purely modern origin. For realism
as expressed in literature is but the sentiment
of the obvious and the true; and in the days
when art was a splendid novelty, the first poets,
as also the first painters, sought their inspirations
directly from the primal source of all reality,—that
is, from Nature herself.</p>

<p class='c011' >Nature, therefore, is the mother of realism,
artistically considered, and Homer was its first
exponent; for not only was the actuality of his
subject never neglected for the purely ideal, but
it was also a first experience.</p>

<p class='c011' >But the impressions produced by the real undergo
in the mere transcription certain modifications,
which are greater or less according to
the organization of the exponent; and while
some of the subject’s delicate aroma invariably
escapes in its passage, however transitory,
from brain to canvas, the proper conservation
of what remains constitutes the work of art
on whose opulence succeeding generations are
nourished, and from which, in turn, other impressions
are derived; and where the original
exponent has artistically transcribed that which
he has seen and felt, his followers express not
that which reality suggests to them, but that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
which Nature suggested to him, and the original
types of the one become the modified models
of the others, until in descending the centuries
reality becomes unrecognizable, and art and
literature through constant copying of copies
become at last enervated and meaningless.</p>

<p class='c011' >When, therefore, the poetry of the Greeks
was becoming entangled in the subtleties of versification,
it received a fresh and vigorous impulsion
from Theocritus, who, disregarding the
set rules of his contemporaries, and returning to
the direct observation of reality, expressed not
only the ideal, as poetry should, but also Nature
in her most humble and familiar details, and
represented his Shepherdess as beautiful but
unkempt, the odor of cattle about her, and with
her hands hardened by contact with the horns
of the steers. Pictures of the obvious and the
true should represent, therefore, not only the
beautiful but the repulsive, not only that which
is unpleasant but that which is agreeable; and
the Shepherdess of Theocritus, in her unkempt
beauty, would be as untrue to nature had she
not the odor of the cattle about her as are the
patched and powdered <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bergères</span> with which Watteau
charmed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pompadour.</span></p>

<p class='c011' >Nature loves and abounds in contrasts, as
witness the toad squatting beneath the rose
bush; and while either may afford a separate
study, yet the union of the two is necessary in
a faithful picture of what actually exists.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
When, therefore, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villon</span> broke away from the
stilted and flowery madrigals of the school of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charles d’Orléans,</span> and sought anew for the
simplicity of Nature, he was but continuing
Theocritus and paving the way for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Diderot</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rétif de la Bretonne.</span> The current of opinion,
however, was adverse to these writers, and it
was not until the early part of the present century,
when the Romantic school, with its vanguards
led by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Staël</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chateaubriand</span>
and with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Victor Hugo</span> for its subsequent
chief, had succeeded after a terrible struggle in
freeing themselves from the established rules
and conventional phrasing of the classicists and
had raised the standard of liberty in art, that
many of the prejudices which the Academicians
had engendered disappeared, and the ground,
swept clean and clear, was prepared for the advent
of a new teacher.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was at this propitious moment that Balzac,
already famous through his “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Physiologie du Mariage,</span>”
presented his credentials in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peau
de Chagrin,</span>” and with an audacity unparalleled
in literature represented his hero as troubled not
only about the state of his mistress’ affections,
but also as to whether he would have money
enough to pay her fare in a cab.</p>

<p class='c011' >The stupefaction and indignation of the purists
at this unheard-of infraction of their formal
style were indescribable, but the Romantic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
school upheld the innovation, and the new generation
applauded the realistic portrayal of the
penniless student who went to an evening entertainment
on the points of his shoes, while
dreading a splash of mud more than a shot
from a pistol.</p>

<p class='c011' >In this respect, therefore, the “Peau de
Chagrin” marked the first return in the nineteenth
century to the real and to the true;
it gave a fresh impulse to an expiring literature,
and constituted the corner-stone of the
Realistic school, which has found such able
exponents not only in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Goncourts</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Flaubert,</span> but in Dickens, Thackeray, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourgénieff,</span>
and a host of lesser lights.</p>

<p class='c011' >But Balzac’s incontestable superiority over
other writers consists in his descriptions of the
habits and customs of every-day life, and in his
perception and rendition of the delicate and
innumerable shadings which accompany their
thousand complications, in the scenes of private
life which he depicted, in the little mysterious
dramas which take place every day in
every social sphere, and especially in his portraits.
The exactitude of the transcription, the
delicacy of the shading, and the profusion and
realism of detail are such that it would almost
seem as though reality itself had been transported
and placed before the eyes of the reader.</p>

<p class='c011' >The third and last number of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
Parisienne</span>” contains a criticism of Balzac’s on
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chartreuse de Parme,</span>” in which, in alluding
to the author, he says, “Stendhal is one
of the most remarkable writers of the day, but
in his work form is neglected; he writes as a
bird sings.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Form, the absence of which he noticed in
Stendhal, was to him a source of continued care
and preoccupation, and he would often spend
an hour in burnishing a single sentence. With
all his facility of conception, execution was exceedingly
laborious, and his admiration of Gautier’s
ability to dash off without an erasure a
warm-colored and impeccable article, while unbounded,
was not unmixed with a certain conviction
that the work would be improved by a
thorough revision.</p>

<p class='c011' >As has been seen, Balzac spent almost ten
years in forming his hand and chastening his
style, and the courage which he then manifested
was equaled only by the patience with
which he sought to improve the coloring of his
afterwork. As a grammarian he is unsurpassed,
and the faults which are noticeable in many
of his works are for the most part purely
clerical, and due to his mania for writing his
books on proof-sheets instead of in manuscript.
As an innovator he was of course attacked,—all
innovators are,—and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sainte-Beuve,</span> whose
manner of writing Balzac had characterized as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
macaroni, continually ridiculed his style and
form of expression. In this respect, however,
it should be remembered that at the time of
Balzac’s advent into literature the French language
had been passed through a strainer so
fine that no terms remained to express anything
beyond the purely conventional; and
Balzac, who was thoroughly impressed with Aristotle’s
idea that the inexpressible does not
exist, was almost obliged to create a language
of his own; and in his endeavor to express
himself with realistic clearness he seized upon
every suggestive technicality which he encountered
in science, in the green room, the alcoves
of the hospital, or the by-ways of Paris, and
built a vocabulary from all that was most expressive
in the different strata of existence. It
was he who invented “chic” and many other
terms of an equally felicitous nature.</p>

<p class='c011' >“As for neologisms, as the critics call them,”
he said, “who, I would like to know, has a
right to give alms to a language, unless it be
its writers? Of course I create words, but my
parvenus will become nobles in time.”</p>

<p class='c011' >But through discipline and constant attention
Balzac’s style assumed at last the undulatory
rhythm of the Romantic school, and
became not only picturesque, mathematical,
and peculiarly incisive, but the model of many
of the prominent writers of to-day.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
The attacks of the critics were not confined,
however, to his style and form of expression;
charges of personal as well as literary immorality
were brought against him, and it is curious
to note that while Venice reveled through an
entire carnival in a masquerade of his characters
his books were prohibited in Rome and
Madrid.</p>

<p class='c011' >Personally considered, Balzac was much more
of a Benedictine than a disciple of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rabelais;</span>
even his student days were those of an anchorite,
and purity of life was to him not only a
refinement, but a basis indispensable to elevation
of thought, and an essential in the production
of any work of enduring value. Disorder
he regarded as fatal to talent, and Gautier
says that he preached what he practiced,
and recommended to him that he should visit
his Dulcinea but once a year, and then only
for half an hour. “Write to her, if you wish
to,” he said; “it forms the style.” In his
books he has, it is true, agreeably painted the
seductions of vice, but its contagious and destructive
effects are rigorously exposed; and
through all the struggles of his characters probity,
purity, and self-denial are alone triumphant.
In what, then, does his immorality consist?
In his vast conception, it was necessary, he explained,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
here to signalize an abuse and here
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
to point out an evil; but every writer who has
an aim and who breaks a fresh lance in the
domain of thought is invariably considered immoral.
Socrates was immoral; Christ was immoral:
both were persecuted by the people
whom they reformed.</p>

<p class='c011' >In describing in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine</span>”
all the elements of society, in grasping it in the
immensity of its agitations, it was inevitable
that one part should expose more wickedness
than virtue, that one part of the fresco represented
a culpable group: hence the critic has
brought his charge of immorality without observing
the morality of other parts destined to
form a perfect contrast. And in this particular
we must observe that the most conscientious
moralists are agreed that society is
incapable of producing as many good as evil
actions, yet in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine</span>” the
virtuous characters exceed in number those of
a reprehensible disposition.</p>

<p class='c011' >Blamable actions, faults, crimes, from the
slightest to the most grave, find therein an invariable
punishment, human or divine, evident
or secret; and while it would be impossible to
clothe two or three thousand characters in
white and orange blossoms, it must be evident
even to the most careless observer that the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marneffes,</span> male and female, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hulots, Brideaus</span>
<em>e tutti quanti</em>, are not imagined,—they
are simply described.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the story of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Albert Savarus</span>” Balzac
drew a picture of the hero which, with slight
modifications, might have served as his own.</p>

<p class='c011' >He was tall and somewhat stout. His hands
were those of a prelate, and his head was that
of a Nero. His hair was black and dense, and
his forehead, furrowed by sabre-cuts of thought,
was high and massive. His complexion was
of an olive hue; his nose was prominent and
slightly arched; his mouth was sympathetic,
and his chin firm. But his most remarkable
characteristic was the expression of his gold-brown
eyes, which, eloquent with interrogations
and replies, seemed, instead of receiving light
from without, to project jets of interior flame.</p>

<p class='c011' >His many vicissitudes had endowed him with
an air of such calm tranquillity as might have
disconcerted a thunderbolt; while his voice, at
once penetrating and soft, had the charm attributed
to Talma’s.</p>

<p class='c011' >In conversation persuasive and magnetic, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
held his auditors breathless in a torrent of
words and gesture. He convinced almost at
will, and his imagination, once unbridled, was
sufficient to cause a vertigo. “He frightens
me,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gérard de Nerval;</span> “he is enough to
drive one crazy.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“He possessed,” Gautier said, “a swing, an
eloquence, and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brio</span></i> which were perfectly irresistible.
Gliding from one subject to another,
he would pass from an anecdote to a philosophical
reflection, from an observation to a description.
As he spoke, his face flushed, his
eyes became peculiarly luminous, his voice assumed
different inflections, while at times he
would burst out laughing, amused by the comic
apparitions which he saw before describing,
and announced, in this way, by a sort of <i>fanfare</i>,
the entrance of his caricatures and witticisms.
The misfortunes of a precarious existence,
the annoyances of debt, fatigue, excessive
work, even illness, were unable to change this
striking characteristic of continual and Rabelaisian
joviality.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Friends, enemies, editors, strangers, money-lenders,
and usurers, all with whom he came
in contact, were fascinated and coerced by the
extraordinary magnetism which he exerted
without effort, and the most vigorous intellects
were bewildered by his projects of fortune and
dreams of glory.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
Attracted by the mine of wealth which the
theatre opens to the popular playwright; and
burdened with a real or imaginary weight of
debt, from which one or two dramas, if favorably
received, would free him entirely; and desirous,
moreover, of experiencing the delirious
intoxication which the plaudits of the gallery
bring to the successful dramatist, Balzac’s inflammable
imagination became a veritable whirlwind
of plots and epigrams whenever a new
play was well received.</p>

<p class='c011' >But for the playwright, as for the mechanic,
an apprenticeship is obligatory, and, though
Balzac’s novels contained action and analysis,
drama and observation, it was not, as we have
seen, until after a long and laborious preparation
that he was enabled to attract the attention
of the public; and it is evident that the heights
which he then scaled were so fatiguing and
time-consuming that his life, wearied by the
struggle, was not of sufficient duration to permit
his winning equal triumphs on the stage.</p>

<p class='c011' >From his early schooldays, however, in which,
it will be remembered, he commenced a tragedy
on the Incas, which was afterwards followed by
a drama in blank verse entitled “Cromwell,”
the stage had possessed an irresistible attraction
for him; and if therein he was not at first
successful, it was perhaps from the very cause
which brought to him his original popularity,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
and the superabundance of his ideas, paradoxical
as it at first appears, was undoubtedly his
greatest stumbling-block.</p>

<p class='c011' >To imagine a plot was nothing, the scenes
were but details, and the outline of a melodrama
was to him the work of as little labor as
would be required in the conception of a pleasing
menu; but when the general plan was
sketched, each scene would suggest a dozen
others, and the Coliseum of Vespasian would
not have been large enough to present the simultaneous
action which the play, at once interminable
and impossible, would have demanded.</p>

<p class='c011' >Another reason for his lack of immediate
success was the jealousy of his colleagues and
the hatred of the critics; and as at that time
the existence of a play depended entirely upon
the manner in which the first representation
was received, it was not very difficult to create
a cabal against this usurper, who, not content
with his legitimate celebrity, seemed, at the
bare mention of a play, to meditate a universal
literary monarchy, in which he would reign supreme;
and while the conquest of both spheres
has been effected by Hugo, Voltaire, and others
of like ilk, yet these authors were careful to
fortify their progress with a book in one hand
and a play in the other, whereas it was not
until Balzac had reached his apogee that he
began a serious attack on the stage.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
It was in the year 1840 that Balzac submitted
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vautrin,</span>” his first drama, to the director of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte-St.-Martin.</span> The play was at once accepted;
for the author’s reputation was not
only gigantic, but the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte-St.-Martin</span> had almost
foundered in successive tempests, and to
the director, who was as penniless as he was
appreciative, the offer was little less than a
godsend. An agreement was signed forthwith,
and Balzac abandoned <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Jardies</span> for more
convenient quarters, where he could attend to
the rehearsals and remodel the scenes on the
stage itself, which, it may be added, he continued
to do up to the very last moment.</p>

<p class='c011' >During these preparations, the boulevards
were agog with excitement. The actors and
the director, accompanied by Balzac’s friends,
wandered daily from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle</span>
to Tontoni’s and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café Riche,</span> exciting
the curiosity of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flaneurs</span></i> by their reticence
or murmured confidences; and Balzac’s
ingress and egress from the theatre were, it is
said, watched and waited for by curious crowds.</p>

<p class='c011' >Never in the history of the drama had a first
representation been so impatiently awaited;
and Balzac, foreseeing the immense sale which
the seats would have, bought up the entire
house, and then, while endeavoring that the
tickets should circulate only among his friends
and their acquaintances, sold the better part of
it over again at a large advance.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
“My dear friend,” he wrote to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dablin,</span> “if
among your acquaintances there are any who
wish to assist at the first representation of
‘Vautrin,’ let me know who they are, as I prefer
to let the boxes to those whom I know
about, rather than to those who are unknown
to me. I particularly wish to have handsome
women present. The demand for boxes is
greater than the supply. The journalists are
to be sacrificed.”</p>

<p class='c011' >To <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gozlan</span> he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I have sent you a ticket for the stalls. The
rehearsals have almost killed me. You will
witness a memorable failure. I have been
wrong, I think, to summon the public.</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Morituri te salutant, Cæsar!</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >Unfortunately, the interval between the sale
of the seats and the first representation was
sufficiently great to permit of two thirds of the
tickets falling into the hands of those who
were unknown or hostile to Balzac; and consequently,
when the great day arrived, the critics
sharpened their knives, and in place of the
indulgent friends and handsome women whom
Balzac had expected to welcome his play the
theatre was crowded with malevolent faces.</p>

<p class='c011' >The title-rôle was taken by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Frédéric Lemaître,</span>
and while the first three acts were received
without any demonstrations, either of
approval or disapprobation, over the fourth
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
there burst a tempest which, since the birth-night
of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hernani,</span>” was unequaled in the annals
of the stage; for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lemaître,</span> reappearing in
the costume of a Mexican general, seemed—whether
by accident or design, it has never
been clearly understood—to present an insulting
resemblance to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis Philippe,</span> whose eldest
son happened to be in one of the most
conspicuous boxes.</p>

<p class='c011' >The entire house, from pit to gallery, re-echoed
with hisses and catcalls. Threats and
even blows were exchanged, for here and there,
in spite of the general indignation, a few still
remained faithful to Balzac.</p>

<p class='c011' >Through <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lemaître’s</span> eccentricity, the battle
was lost and the drama killed. Further representations
were prohibited by the government;
and though, a few days later, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rémusat</span>
called upon Balzac, and offered in the name of
the state an indemnity for the pecuniary loss
which he had sustained, it was haughtily refused.
“If my play was justly prohibited,
there is,” he said, “no reason why I should be
indemnified; if it be otherwise, I can accept
nothing, unless an indemnity be also made to
the manager and actors of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte-St.-Martin.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >Two years after the failure of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vautrin,</span>” and
entirely unaffected by its sudden collapse, Balzac
knocked at the door of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</span> which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
was at that time under the management of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lireux.</span>
By this gentleman Balzac was received
with the greatest cordiality; for while his first
play had fallen flat, yet it had fallen with such
a crash that, in the lapse of time, it was difficult
to distinguish its failure from success.
Moreover, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</span> was bankrupt, and as
Balzac, with his customary enthusiasm, offered
nothing less than a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Golconda</span> in his manuscript,
he was fêted, caressed, and altogether received
with open arms.</p>

<p class='c011' >From the office to the green room, from the
door-keeper to the scene-shifters, smiles, compliments,
and welcomes were showered upon
him, and he was unanimously requested to
read his play at once. As soon, therefore, as
the actors were assembled and silence obtained,
Balzac began to read “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Ressources
de Quinola.</span>” At first thick and embarrassed,
his voice gradually grew clearer, and expressed
the most fugitive undulations of the dialogue.
His audience laughed and wept by turns, and
Balzac laughed and wept with them; the entire
troop was fascinated, and applauded as
only actors can. Suddenly, however, at the end
of the fourth act, Balzac stopped short, and
explained in the simplest and most unaffected
manner that, as he had not yet written the
fifth, he would be obliged to recite it to them.</p>

<p class='c011' >The stupor and surprise of his audience can
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
be more readily imagined than described: for
the fifth act of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quinola</span>” is the unraveling of
all the tangled threads, the union of all the
joints; it is the climax and logical termination
of all that has gone before; and Balzac, as he
calmly rolled up his manuscript and tied it
with a bit of string, easily, fluently, and unhesitatingly
continued the drama through the six
final scenes, and without a break, without a
pause, through a torrent of varied intonations,
led his listeners by a magnificent tour de force
to the very fall of the curtain.</p>

<p class='c011' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lireux</span> was bewildered and entranced. “The
rehearsals shall commence to-morrow,” he said.
“But to what address, M. de Balzac, shall I
send the announcements?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“It is unnecessary to send any,” Balzac replied.
“I can come without them.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Ah, no, that is impossible. There will be a
rehearsal one day, and none the next; and I
never know until the morning at what hour a
rehearsal is to take place. What is your address?”</p>

<p class='c011' >But Balzac had not the least intention of
telling where he lived, and either because he
was playing hide-and-go-seek with his creditors,
or else was at that time possessed of one of the
inexplicable manias which caused him at times
to keep his habitat a secret even from his most
intimate friends, he refused flatly to impart the
wished-for information.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
“I do not see what we can do,” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lireux</span>
murmured helplessly, “unless we use a carrier
pigeon.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“I do,” replied Balzac, ever fertile in expedients.
“Listen to me. Send a messenger up
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées</span> with the notice every morning
at nine o’clock. When he reaches the Arc
de l’Étoile, let him turn to the left, and he will
see a man beneath the twentieth tree, who will
pretend to be looking up in the branches for a
sparrow.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“A sparrow?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“A sparrow or any other bird.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“My pigeon, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Let me continue. Your messenger will approach
my sentinel, and will say to him, ‘I
have it.’ Thereupon my sentinel will reply,
‘Since you have it, what are you waiting for?’
Then your messenger will hand the notice to
him, and immediately go away, without once
looking behind him. I will attend to the rest.”</p>

<p class='c011' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lireux</span> saw no objection to this fantastic
whim, and contented himself by expressing the
hope that if the twentieth tree should be destroyed
by lightning M. de Balzac would see
no insuperable objection to posting his sentinel
at the twenty-first.</p>

<p class='c011' >“No,” Balzac answered, “but I should prefer
the nineteenth; the number is more quaint.”</p>

<p class='c011' >This plan amicably arranged, the actors
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
agreed upon, and the date of the first representation
settled, Balzac proceeded to talk finance.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Beside the customary royalty, I wish the
entire house for the first three nights.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“But what shall I get?” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lireux</span> timidly inquired.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Half the profits, which will be incalculable.”</p>

<p class='c011' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lireux</span> reflected for a moment. “Very
good,” he said; “I accept.”</p>

<p class='c011' >From the first rehearsal Balzac recommenced
with “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quinola</span>” the treatment to which “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vautrin</span>”
had been subjected. Sometimes a phrase
was altered, sometimes a scene, while at others
an entire act was remodeled. That which
pleased him one day displeased him the next,
and each rehearsal brought fresh corrections
and alterations, until the original manuscript
was entirely obliterated with erasures and new
ideas.</p>

<p class='c011' >Besides undergoing the mental and physical
labor attendant on these rehearsals, Balzac undertook
the entire charge of the sale of the
seats, or rather the entire charge of refusing
seats to all comers; for the box office was
opened merely for form’s sake, and tickets were
to be had only of Balzac in person. To obtain
one was not so much a question of money as
of position and influence. The orchestra stalls
he reserved for the nobility, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant-scènes</span>
for the court circle; the boxes in the first gallery
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
were for the ambassadors and plenipotentiaries;
the second gallery was for the statesmen,
the third for the moneyed aristocracy, the
fourth for the select bourgeoisie. “As for the
critics,” he said, “they can buy their seats, if
there are any left, and there will be none.”</p>

<p class='c011' >As a rule, therefore, when any one asked for
a box, Balzac would reply, “Too late: last
one just sold to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Princesse de Machin</span> and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Duchesse de Chose.</span>” During the
first few days of the sale, seats were in consequence
sold at extraordinary prices; but later
on the anxiety to obtain them decreased, and
during the week preceding the first performance
Balzac was very glad to dispose of them
to any one at the regular rates.</p>

<p class='c011' >On the 6th of March, 1842, thirteen days before
the play was to be performed, he wrote to
a friend as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span class='sc'>Dear Sofka</span>,—Send me the address of
the Princess Constantine Razumovska, that I
may learn from her whether she wishes a box.
Let me know also whether the two Princesses
Troubetskoï want boxes, whether Kraïeska
wishes one, whether the Malakoffs, and the
Countess Léon, and the Countess Nariskine,—seven
boxes in all. I must know, too, whether
they want them in the upper or lower tier of
the first gallery. I wish the handsome women
in front.... It is a favor to be admitted to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
this solemnity. There are at the theatre a
hundred and fifty applications for boxes from
people whom I do not know and who will get
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011' >On the 12th he wrote to the same person:
“The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant-scènes</span> are for the king and the cabinet;
they take them by the year. I can only
give, therefore, to the Princess Troubetskoï a
box in the first gallery, but it is one of the best
in the house.... The costumes have cost
20,000 francs; the scenery is entirely new.
Every one insists that the play is a masterpiece,
and that makes me shudder. In any event, it
will be a terrible solemnity. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lamartine</span> has
asked for a box; I will place him among the
Russians. Every morning I receive thirty or
forty applications, but I will have no one whom
I do not know about.... Tell your Russian
friends that I must have the names and addresses,
<em>each accompanied by a written and personal
recommendation</em> of those of their friends
(men) who wish stalls. There are over fifty
people a day who come under assumed names
and refuse to give their address; <em>they are enemies,
who wish to ruin the piece</em>. In a week I
shall not know what I am about. We are
obliged to observe the most severe precautions.
I am intoxicated with the play.”</p>

<p class='c011' >The severe precautions resulted on the night
of the first representation in a half-empty house.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
Few imagined that seats could really be had,
and it was even reported that Balzac had been
obliged to refuse a seat to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Nemours.</span>
The amateurs resigned themselves,
therefore, almost without a struggle, and determined
that as they could not obtain seats for
the first performance they would find solace
in the second or third; but on reading the articles
which appeared the next day they felt
little need of consolation, for the fate of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vautrin</span>”
had been repeated, and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quinola</span>” had
fallen flat. The most sympathetic of all the
criticisms which then appeared was one contained
in Le National for the 16th of March,
1842. It runs as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“The subject of M. de Balzac’s drama was
excellent, but unfortunately, through eccentricity
or negligence, he passed but to one side of the
idea, without resolutely entering it and extracting
all its wealth.</p>

<p class='c011' >“The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</span> is the theatre of tumultuous
representations, but never has this terrible battle-field
offered such a conglomeration of exclamations
and confusing cries. The pit, like a
sharp-shooter, took up an ambush behind the
substantives and verbs, and slaughtered the play
while it maimed the actors, who, brave though
wounded, struggled on to the end with a praiseworthy
and melancholy courage. At times the
comedy, through its sudden flashes of originality
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
and abrupt cannonades of wit, seemed
about to rout the enemy and wave aloft a tattered
but victorious flag. The faults, however,
were too numerous and the errors too grave,
and in spite of many advantages the battle, in
the end, was fairly lost.”</p>

<p class='c011' >But in spite of the derision, insults, and abuse
with which the first representation was received,
in spite of the financial and dramatic shipwreck,
after the commotion had subsided and the audience
had dispersed, Balzac, superior to destiny
and indifferent to fate, was found fast
asleep and snoring in his box.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011' >In addition to “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vautrin</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quinola,</span>”
three other plays of Balzac’s have been produced,
namely, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paméla Giraud,” “La Marâtre,</span>”
and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Faiseur” (“Mercadet”),</span> of which
the first was performed at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gaieté</span> in September,
1843, and enjoyed a moderate success.
Concerning the second, M. Hostein, formerly
director of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théatre-Historique,</span> has
offered some curious information.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Balzac, it
appears, called upon him one day, and explained
that for some time past he had been
thinking over an historical drama for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théatre-Historique.</span></p>
<p class='c014' >“I shall call it,” he said, “‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre et Catharine,</span>’
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
Peter the Great and Catharine of Russia.
That, I think, would be an excellent subject.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Treated by you, it could not be otherwise.
But are you far advanced, M. de Balzac?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“It is all here,” Balzac answered, tapping his
forehead. “I have but to write it out, and, if
you care to, the first tableau can be rehearsed
the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Can you give me an idea of this first tableau?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Certainly. We are in a Russian inn. You
can see it from here. In this inn plenty of action:
the troops are passing by; soldiers come
in, drink, chat for a moment, and then off
again, but everything is done rapidly. Among
the people of the inn is a servant-girl, young,
active, and alert,—pay attention to her: her figure
is good; she is not handsome, but she is peculiarly
attractive. The soldiers jest with her;
she smiles at every one, but her admirers are
obliged to be careful, for any familiarity is answered
with a slap, which is as good as a blow.</p>

<p class='c011' >“A soldier enters who is more daring than
the others. He is charged with a particular mission;
his time, therefore, is his own. He can
drink at his ease and chat with the servant, if
she pleases him; for that matter, she pleases
him at first sight, and she likes the soldier, too.
‘Here,’ he says, catching hold of her arm,
‘sit down at this table and drink with me.’</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
“The soldier takes a seat, and the girl does
the same. Noticing, however, some objection
on the part of the innkeeper, he rises angrily,
and strikes the table with his fist. ‘If any one
interferes with what I do, I will burn the whole
shanty down.’</p>

<p class='c011' >“And he would have done it, too. He is
a good soldier, but terrible with his inferiors.
The old innkeeper motions to the girl to obey.
The soldier sits down again. He places one
arm tenderly about the girl’s neck, and then,
having drunk deeply, he whispers, ‘I will give
you a better home than this.’ While they are
talking together, inattentive to the others, the
door at the back opens. An officer enters, and
every one rises, with respect. The soldiers
make the regulation salute, and stand motionless.
The soldier and the servant alone remain
seated. The officer notices this, and grows angry.
He looks at the girl and advances toward
the table; having reached the soldier, he
raises his arm, and lets it fall with a terrible
force on the shoulder of the poor devil, who
bends beneath the shock.</p>

<p class='c011' >“‘Up, rascal!’ the officer cries. ‘Go write
your name and regiment, and bring the paper
to me.’</p>

<p class='c011' >“At the first moment, that is to say on receiving
the blow, without knowing by whom it
had been directed, the soldier turns to avenge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
himself; but on recognizing his superior he
rises automatically, salutes the officer, and goes
to another table to obey the command. The
officer, on his part, examines the servant with
renewed attention. Her appearance pleases
and calms him. The soldier returns, and respectfully
presents his paper.</p>

<p class='c011' >“‘Very good,’ the officer says, as he returns
it to him. ‘Off with you.’</p>

<p class='c011' >“The soldier salutes him again, turns right
about face, and marches off, without even looking
at the girl. The officer, however, smiles
at her, and she smiles at him.</p>

<p class='c011' >“‘A good-looking man,’ she thinks.</p>

<p class='c011' >“The good-looking man takes the seat previously
occupied by the soldier, orders the best
that the inn affords, and invites the servant to
keep him company. She accepts without hesitation.
The conversation begins, and they
are soon quite friendly. A stranger appears
at the doorway. He is enveloped in a long
cloak. At his entrance, men and women fall
on their knees; some of them even bend their
foreheads to the ground. As was the case with
the soldier, the officer does not notice what is
going on behind him. His seductive companion
has captivated him completely. In a moment
of enthusiasm, the officer exclaims, ‘You
are divine! I will take you with me. You
shall have a beautiful apartment, where it will
be always warm.’</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
“From afar the stranger scrutinizes the couple,
and, in spite of himself, the girl’s sympathetic
appearance attracts his attention. He
approaches the table, and, throwing open his
cloak, stands with his arms crossed on his
breast.</p>

<p class='c011' >“The officer looks around, and, immediately
rising, bends on one knee, and stammers these
words:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“‘Your pardon, sire!’</p>

<p class='c011' >“‘Rise.’</p>

<p class='c011' >“Like the soldier, the officer then stands
erect, awaiting the good pleasure of his master.
The master, meanwhile, is engaged in
looking at the servant, and she, in turn, is
fearlessly admiring the all-powerful Czar.</p>

<p class='c011' >“‘You may go,’ he says to the officer. ‘I
will keep this woman. She shall have a palace.’</p>

<p class='c011' >“It was in this way that Peter the Great met
for the first time the woman who afterwards
became Catharine of Russia....</p>

<p class='c011' >“And now tell me, what do you think of my
prologue?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Very curious, very original; but the rest of
it?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“That you shall have in a little while; in
the mean time, I am planning an entirely novel
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise-en-scène.</span> Russia is for our theatres, and
especially for yours, an unexplored and fecund
mine. We will be the first to introduce it.”</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
Balzac left me in a state of great enthusiasm,
and I built mountains of hopes on the inevitable
success of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre et Catharine.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >When I saw him again, however, everything
had changed. He had given up the Russian
drama for the moment, but promised to complete
it later on. He had, he said, thought it
over. It was a colossal undertaking, in which
nothing should be neglected; and as the details
concerning certain ceremonies were wanting,
he proposed to take a trip to Moscow during
the winter, and study the subject on the
ground itself. He begged me, therefore, not
to insist upon its immediate production, and
offered another play in the place of the one
thus postponed.</p>

<p class='c011' >In spite of my disappointment, I could, of
course, do nothing but submit, and in sheer
despair I asked him to tell me something of
his new piece.</p>

<p class='c011' >“It will be horrible,” Balzac contentedly replied.</p>

<p class='c011' >“How, horrible?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Understand me: it is not a question of a
heavy melodrama, in which the villain burns
the house down, and runs the inmates through
and through,—not at all. My play is to be a
simple comedy, in which everything is calm,
tranquil, and pleasing. The men play placidly
at whist, the women laugh and chat over
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
their worsted work, everything announces harmony
and order; but beneath this calm surface
passions are at work, and the drama ferments,
till at last it bursts forth like the flame
of a conflagration.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“You are in your element, sir. Then your
plot is found?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Completely. It was chance, our habitual
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">collaborateur,</span> that furnished me with it. I
know a family,—whom I will not name,—composed
of a husband, a daughter by a first
marriage, and a stepmother, still young and
childless. The two women adore each other.
The little attentions of the one and the caressing
tenderness of the other are admired by
all who know them. I, too, thought it charming,
at first; then I became surprised, not that
a stepdaughter and stepmother should love
each other,—for there is nothing unnatural in
such an affection,—but that they should love
each other so dearly. Excess spoils all things.
I began, therefore, to observe them more
closely, and a few trivial incidents served to
confirm my impression that all was not as it
appeared. Finally, a few evenings ago, all
doubt on the subject was removed. When I
entered the drawing-room, it was almost deserted,
and I saw the daughter leaving the
room without having seen me; in so doing, she
glanced at her stepmother, and what a look
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
she gave her! It was like the thrust of a dagger.
The stepmother was engaged in putting
out the candles on the whist-table. She turned
to the girl; their eyes met, and the most gracious
of smiles played on their lips. The door
closed on the girl, and the expression on the
stepmother’s face changed suddenly to one of
bitter contraction. All this, you will readily
understand, passed like a flash of lightning;
but I had seen quite enough, and I said to myself,
Here are two creatures who loathe each
other. What had happened? I do not know,
and I never want to; but from that moment
the entire drama unrolled before me.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“And for the first representation, you will,
of course, offer a box to these ladies, that they
may profit by the moral which your play will
necessarily point?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Assuredly I shall do so; and since you
mention it, I will be obliged if you will reserve
an extra box for me. I have not, however,
the slightest intention of teaching them a
lesson, and I consider that a novelist or dramatist
would be highly presumptuous did he
write with such an object. An author should
influence only through instinct or chance. To
return, however, to these ladies: that they play
a comedy of tenderness is to me beyond a
doubt, but as between ourselves matters will,
in all probability, rest where they are. My ferocious
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
deductions are but the fruit of my imagination,
and will never, I trust, have anything
in common with the realities of their
existence; but in the event of their disunion
containing the germs of a violent climax, it is
very possible that my play will pull them up
with a round turn.”</p>

<p class='c011' >The months rolled on. Balzac went to Russia,
and as soon as I heard of his return I
called upon him at his residence in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue
Fortunée.</span> A servant in a red vest took my
card, and a few moments later I was ushered
into a low-ceilinged room. Balzac was at the
other end of it, and cried out from afar, “Here
is your manuscript!” Then I saw my author
standing by his work-table, clothed in a
long, monkish robe of white linen, with one
hand resting on a mass of paper. I ran to
him.</p>

<p class='c011' >On the first page Balzac had written in large
characters, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gertrude, tragédie bourgeoise en
cinq actes, en prose.</span>” On the back was the
proposed distribution of the play. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Melingue</span>
was designated for the rôle of Ferdinand, the
lover of the stepmother and daughter; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Dorval</span> was to play <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gertrude;</span> and the other
parts were to be filled by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mathis, Barré,</span> etc.</p>

<p class='c011' >Beneath these names the author had minutely
indicated everything which concerned the play,—the
action, the furniture, and the decorations;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
he had even given the measure for the
double carpet which he judged indispensable
to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise-en-scène.</span></p>

<p class='c011' >It was then agreed that the play should be
read the next day in the presence of Madame
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dorval</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Melingue.</span> When, therefore, we
had all assembled at the appointed time, he
read it through from beginning to end, without
stopping, and then quietly remarked, “It is
much too long; it must be cut down a quarter.”
Not only did he cut it down, but he changed
the title to that of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Marâtre,</span>” which it has
since so gloriously borne.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was first represented in June, 1848, in the
midst of the most disastrous political circumstances....
The theatres were necessarily
abandoned, but such is the power of genius
that all the bold and brave in literature who
remained in Paris gathered that night, and
received Balzac’s work with the sympathy and
applause which it so richly merited.</p>

<p class='c011' >The next morning I paid him a visit. “We
had quite a victory last night!” I joyously exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Yes,” he answered; “a victory like that of
Charles XII.”</p>

<p class='c011' >On taking leave of him, I asked where he
had been during the representation. “Why,”
he answered, with a smile, “I was in a box
with those ladies. They were greatly interested
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
in the play. At the moment when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauline</span>
poisons herself, that her stepmother may be
accused of assassinating her, the young girl
screamed with terror; the tears were in her
eyes, and she looked reproachfully at me. Then
she grasped her stepmother’s hand, and raised
it to her lips with a movement”—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Of sincerity?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Ah, yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“You see, then, that your play may serve as
a lesson.”</p>

<p class='c014' >Balzac’s last play, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Faiseur,</span>” was produced
for the first time at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gymnase,</span> a year
after his death, under the title of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercadet.</span>”
Its success was immediate, and its hundredth
performance was the occasion of an article
by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Albéric Second</span> in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Constitutionnel,</span>”
18 June, 1852, which is at once so graceful and
fantastic that its reproduction here cannot fail
to afford some pleasure to the readers of the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine:</span>”—</p>

<p class='c014' >The hundredth performance of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercadet</span>”
was given the other evening at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gymnase-Dramatique.
“Mercadet”</span> is, it will be remembered,
the posthumous piece of M. de Balzac,
which at the time of its production excited
such great curiosity. Without any previous
agreement, but none the less certain of meeting,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
a dozen of us, all passionate admirers of
the illustrious deceased, found ourselves, that
evening, intermingled with the line which from
six o’clock in the evening had been undulating
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle</span> to
the door of the theatre. We had all assisted
ten months before at the first representation
of the play, and we piously reassembled at this
jubilee of glory and genius in the same manner
as we had gone the year before, and in the
same manner that each year we shall go, on
the 18th of August, to wreathe with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">immortelles</span>
the tomb of the great writer.</p>

<p class='c011' >M. de Balzac was not one of those who inspire
lukewarm affection, and they who have
had the honor of knowing him preserve his
memory religiously in their hearts. That life of
his, full of struggles incessantly renewed, the
hourly and truceless combat which he waged,
sum up so completely the existence of the literary
men of the nineteenth century that it is
impossible for us to consider his grand and
mournful figure otherwise than as the personification
of an entire class. It is for this reason
that God, who is sovereignly just, will accord
to him hereafter a glory as great and incontestable
as his life was tormented and sad. It
is for this reason that it behooves us, who are
the humble sacristans of the temple in which
he was the radiant high priest, to see that his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
altars are ever adorned with fresh flowers and
that the incense ceaselessly burns in the censers.</p>

<p class='c011' >When we entered the theatre, it was, with the
exception of a few boxes and a number of orchestra
stalls which had been sold in advance,
entirely filled. My seat was next to that of
a gentleman apparently about forty-five years
old. His bearing was exceedingly aristocratic;
he was dressed with the most exquisite elegance,
and his buttonhole bloomed with a rosette
in which were intermingled in harmonious
confusion all the orders of Europe and every
shade of the rainbow. My neighbor was carelessly
turning the pages of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Entr’acte,</span>”
and I took great pleasure in studying his well-poised
head; wondering the while whether I
had not met him somewhere before, and what
his name might be. When he had finished
reading he rose, turned his back to the stage,
drew an opera-glass from his pocket, and began
to examine the house; an E and an R, surmounted
by a count’s coronet, were engraved
in letters of gold on the case which he placed
on his seat. From time to time he bowed and
waved his hand. My eyes mechanically followed
the direction of his own, and I was not
a little surprised at noticing that his smiles
and salutations were addressed exclusively to
the unoccupied boxes. When he passed all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
the boxes in review he turned his attention to
the orchestra stalls, and the strange phenomenon
was repeated. His opera-glass, flitting
from stall to stall, stopped only at the empty
ones; he would then bow, or make an almost
imperceptible sign with the ends of his delicately
gloved fingers. Dominated by that detestable
pride which causes us to consider as
insane all those whose actions or remarks are
unintelligible to us, I murmured to myself, He
is crazy. Then, as though he wished to remove
the slightest doubt which I might have retained
on this point, my neighbor bent over toward
the seat at his left, and appeared to exchange
a few words with an imaginary spectator. This
seat was one of those which had been let in
advance, and it was probable that its tenant,
who was still absent, was interested only in the
great play. I have omitted to state that the
performance began with a little vaudeville.</p>

<p class='c011' >At this moment one of my friends entered
the orchestra, passed before me, shook my
hand, and called me by name. My neighbor
immediately turned around, gazed attentively
at me for a moment or two, and then said,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Why, my dear fellow countryman,—for you
are from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Charente,</span> I believe,—I am delighted
to see you.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“To whom have I the honor of speaking?”
I asked, in great surprise.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
My neighbor drew from his pocket a card,
which he gallantly presented to me. My astonishment
was so great that I almost screamed
aloud; fortunately, however, I preserved my
presence of mind. On the card, I read these
words:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Comte Eugène de Rastignac.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rastignac?</span>” I repeated, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c011' >“In person.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“The one who was born at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ruffec?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Precisely.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“The cousin of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Beauséant?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Himself.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is it you who lived at the boarding-house
kept by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Vauquer, née De Conflans?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“And who knew the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père Goriot</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vautrin?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“You exist, then?” I stupidly inquired.</p>

<p class='c011' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rastignac</span> began to smile.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Do you think that I present the appearance
of a phantom?” he asked, as he gracefully
twirled his moustache.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Sir,” I said, “I can readily understand that
M. de Balzac should have borrowed your personality
and extracted a great deal therefrom
for the edification of his readers; but that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
should have taken your name!—that, indeed, is
something that I cannot believe.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“I had authorized him so to do.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“You?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Not only I did so, but all my friends did
the same.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“All, you say?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Of whom do you speak?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Of those who are in the theatre and to
whom I have just bowed.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“But where are they?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Ah, yes; I forgot you cannot see them.”</p>

<p class='c011' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rastignac</span> lightly touched my forehead
with the forefinger of his right hand, and,
light as was his touch, I immediately felt a violent
electric shock, and it seemed as though I
had undergone an operation similar to that of
removing a cataract.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Now look about you,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rastignac,</span>
and he pointed to the boxes and stalls
which I had thought were empty. They were
occupied by ladies and gentlemen, laughing
and talking together in a most unghostlike
fashion.</p>

<p class='c011' >“They are almost all there,” said Madame
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vauquer’s</span> former lodger. “The principal personages
of the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine</span>’ have, like
you, come to salute the hundredth representation
of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercadet,</span>’ and their applause is so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
loud, <em>so loud</em>, that the echo of their bravos will
rejoice Balzac in his tomb.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Am I losing my reason?” I asked myself.</p>

<p class='c011' >“I see that you are skeptical, my dear fellow,”
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rastignac</span> continued, “but let me
give you a few proofs. Here is one which will
satisfy you, I imagine;” and, turning about, he
called to one of the spectators:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Nathan!”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Well, my dear count?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Where and when is your next drama?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“It will be given at the opening of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ambigu-Comique.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Will you send me a box?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Your name is already on the list.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du Bruel!</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“You are becoming lazy, now that you are
a member of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Académie.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“I? I have five acts in rehearsal at the
Vaudeville and two at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Variétés.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“That is not so bad, then. But where is
your wife?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tullia?</span> She is in the third box to the
left.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Alone?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“With <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Palférine.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bixion,</span> your last caricatures were infamous.”</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
“Bah! I would like to see you try your
hand at them, with the censure at your heels.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“How are you, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lou de Lora?</span> How are you,
Stedman? Your exposition is superb. Ah, my
friends, you are the princes of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Musée.</span> But
I say, Stedman, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pradier</span> has just died: there is
a fine place open.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Yes; but then, alas, there are men who
can never be replaced.”</p>

<p class='c011' >All these questions and answers bounded
like the balls which two clever players serve
and receive in a well-played game of tennis.</p>

<p class='c011' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rastignac</span> turned to me. “Are you as
incredulous as before?” he smilingly inquired.</p>

<p class='c011' >“I? God forbid, sir, that I should doubt
your word.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In reality, however, I knew neither what to
think nor what to believe, for I had curiously
examined all these people whom my celebrated
compatriot had addressed, and who, through
M. de Balzac, as well as through their own
achievements, were known and liked throughout
civilized Europe. With the exception of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bixion,</span> who was thin, poorly dressed, and not
decorated, all the others appeared to be in the
most flourishing state of health and fortune.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Tullia du Bruel</span> was as appetizing as
ever, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Palférine,</span> familiarly leaning on
the back of her chair, exposed an ideal shirt
and an impossible vest.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
“Does <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de la Palférine</span> no longer visit
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Rochegude?</span>” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c011' >“He is now entirely devoted to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tullia,</span> and
asserts that, after all, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du Bruel’s</span> cook is the
finest artist in Paris.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Rochegude</span> still living?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“She sits in that second box to the right.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Who is with her?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conti.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“The celebrated musician?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Yes, indeed. You remember the song,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et l’on revient toujours,</span></div>
      <div class='line in1'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A ses premiers amours.</span>’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011' >It was with the greatest eagerness that I
had turned to look at this artificial blonde, who
had been so greatly beloved by the young
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baron Calyste du Guénic. (Vide Béatrix.)</span> A
lace scarf was twisted about her neck in such a
way as to diminish its length. She appeared
worn and fatigued; but her figure was a masterpiece
of composition, and she offered that
compound of light and brilliant drapery, of
gauze and crimped hair, of vivacity and calm,
which is termed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je ne sais quoi.</span></p>

<p class='c011' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conti</span> was also an object of great interest to
me. He looked vexed, out of sorts, and bored,
and seemed to be meditating on the eternal
truth of that aphorism, profound and sombre
as an abyss, which teaches that a cigar once
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
out should never be relighted, and an affection
once buried should never be exhumed.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baron de Nucingen</span> here?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nucingen</span> is confined to his bed with the
gout; he has not two good months out of the
twelve.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“And his wife?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“The baroness no longer goes to the theatre.
Religion, charity, and sermons occupy
every instant of her time. Her father, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père
Goriot,</span> has now a white marble tomb and a
perpetual resting-place in the cemetery of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père
La Chaise.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Where is her sister, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Restaud?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“She died a few years ago, legally separated
from her husband.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Pardon my insatiable curiosity,” I said,
“but ever since I was old enough to read and
think I have not ceased to live with the personages
of the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine.</span>’”</p>

<p class='c011' >“I am glad indeed,” he courteously replied,
“to be able to answer your questions. Is there
anything that you still care to know?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“What has become of the ex-minister of
agriculture and commerce, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte Popinot,</span>
whom we called the little <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anselme Popinot,</span>
in the days of the greatness and decadence
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">César Birotteau?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“He followed the exiled princes to England.”</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
“And <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du Tillet?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du Tillet</span> is no longer in France.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Did he leave for political reasons?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is it possible that you did not hear of his
failure! He absconded one day, with the till,
ruined by Jenny <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cadine</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suzanne du Val-Noble.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Where are the children of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de
Montsauf,</span> that celestial creature, so justly called
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Lys dans la Vallée?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Jacques died of consumption, leaving Madeleine
sole mistress of an enormous fortune. In
spite of what <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Balzac</span> said, I always supposed
that she was secretly in love with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Félix de
Vandernesse.</span> She is in that first <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant-scène.</span>
She is an old maid now, but is none the less an
adorable woman, and the true daughter of her
mother.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Do you know the name of that individual
who has just entered her box?”</p>

now attempting to win <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mlle. de Montsauf</span> and
her millions. But look to the left, in that first
box from the door of the gallery, and see
whether you do not recognize one of the most
curious physiognomies of the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine.</span>’”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Do you mean that stout woman?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Yes; it is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Nourrisau.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vautrin’s</span> aunt?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“In flesh and blood, especially in flesh.
There is the formidable hag who went one day
to the son of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baron Hulot</span> and proposed,
for fifty thousand francs, to rid him of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Marneffe.</span> You must have read about it in
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Cousine Bette.</span>’”</p>

<p class='c011' >“She is not alone, I see.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“She is with her husband.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Her husband? Is it possible that she
found one?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“You forget that she is five or six times millionaire,
and also the general rule that where it
rains millions husbands sprout. Her name is
now <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Gaudessart, née Vautrin.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is it the illustrious <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gaudessart</span> who is the
husband of that horrible creature?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Legally so, I beg you to believe.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Speaking of the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cousine Bette,</span>’ can you
tell me anything of Wencelas Steinbock and
his wife?”</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
“They are perfectly happy. It is young
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hulot</span> who misbehaves; his wife is in that box
over there, with the Steinbocks. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hulot</span> has
told them that he will join them later, and
has probably stated that he had some urgent
law business to attend to; but the truth is that
he is behind the scenes at the opera. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hulot</span>
is not his father’s son for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011' >At this point <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rastignac</span> smiled affectionately
at a white-haired musician, who was
tuning his violin.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is that the Cousin Pons?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011' >“You forget two things: first, that the
Cousin Pons is dead; and secondly, that in his
lifetime he always wore a green velvet coat. But
though Orestes is no more, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pylades</span> still lives.
Damon has survived <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pythias.</span> It is Schmucke
who sits before you. He is very poor; he has
nothing but the fifty francs a month which he
earns here, and the payment of a few piano
lessons at seventy-five centimes each; but he
will not accept any assistance, and, for my
part, I have never seen tatters more proudly
worn.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Can you not,” I asked, “show me <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.
Maxime de Trailles?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Trailles</span> no longer lives in Paris.
When the devil grows stout he turns hermit.
This retired condottiere is now a married man,
the father of a family, and resides in the country.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
He makes speeches at the agricultural
fairs, takes great interest in cattle, and represents
his county at the general assembly of his
department,—<em>the late</em> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maxime de Trailles,</span> as
he is now pleased to call himself.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“And <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Lupeaulx?</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Lupeaulx</span> is a prefect of the first
class. But in place of these gentlemen, you
have before you, in that box, the Count <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Félix
de Vandernesse</span> and the Countess <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nathalie de
Manerville;</span> a little beyond, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grandvilles</span> and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grandlieux;</span> then, the Duke <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Rhétoré,
Laginski, D’Esgrignon Montreveau, Rochefide,</span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D’Ajuda-Ponto.</span> Moreover, there are the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cheffrevilles;</span> but then what a pity it is that
our poor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Camille Maupin</span> is not present at this
solemnity!”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is it of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mlle. des Touches</span> that you speak?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Is she still religiously inclined?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“She died like a saint, two years ago, in a
convent near Nantes. She retired from the
world, you remember, after accomplishing the
marriage of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Calyste du Guénic</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sabine de
Grandlieu.</span> What a woman she was! There
are none like her now.”</p>

<p class='c011' >These last words of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Rastignac</span> were
covered by the three traditional knocks which
precede the rise of the curtain.</p>

<p class='c011' >“‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercadet</span>’ is about to commence,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
“After the first act I will continue my gossip;
provided, of course, that I do not weary you
with it.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Oh, my dear sir!” I cried. “My”—</p>

<p class='c011' >I had not time to complete my phrase; a
friendly but vigorous hand grasped my arm.</p>

<p class='c011' >“So you come to ‘Mercadet’ to sleep, do
you?” said a well-known voice.</p>

<p class='c011' >“I? Am I asleep?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“You are not asleep now, but you were.”</p>

<p class='c011' >I turned quickly around.</p>

<p class='c011' >My neighbor was a fat-faced gentleman,
with blue spectacles, who was peeling an orange
with the most ridiculous gravity.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the boxes and orchestra stalls, wherever
I had thought to see the personages of the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine,</span>” I found only insignificant
faces, of the ordinary and graceless type,—a
collection of obliterated medals.</p>

<p class='c011' >At this moment the curtain rose, the actors
appeared, and the great comedy of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercadet</span>”
was revealed, amid the applause and delight of
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c011' >I had been dreaming, therefore, and if I
had been dreaming I must have been asleep.
But what had provoked my somnolence? Was
it the approach of a storm, the heat of the
theatre, or the vaudeville with which the performance
commenced?</p>

<p class='c011' >Perhaps all three.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010' ><span class='small'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiæ est.”—<span class='sc'>Seneca</span>,
<i>De Tranquillitate Animi</i>, c. 15.</span></span></p>
<p class='c010' >From Balzac’s early manhood his entire existence
was consumed in a feverish pursuit of
wealth; and had the mines of California been
discovered at an earlier date, there is little
doubt that he would have exchanged his pen
for a pick, and sought, in a red shirt, to realize
the millions with which he dowered his
characters.</p>

<p class='c011' >At the outset of his career, he was, as has
been seen, unsuccessful in a business enterprise,
and became, in consequence, heavily involved
in debt. This spectre of the past
haunted him so continually that it not only
found frequent expression in his writings, in
which money became a hymn, but it brought
to him illusions and projects of fortune which
were at once curious and fantastic.</p>

<p class='c011' >At one time, shortly after the publication of
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Facino Cane,</span>”—who, it will be remembered,
was imprisoned in the dungeons of Venice,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
and, in making his escape, discovered the hidden
treasures of the Doges, which he proposed
to seek and share with his biographer,—Balzac
became fairly intoxicated with the delusions
of his hero, and his dreams of secreted wealth
assumed such a semblance of reality that he at
last imagined, or pretended that he had learned,
the exact spot where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toussaint Louverture</span> had
buried his famous booty.</p>

<p class='c011' >“‘The Gold Bug’ of Edgar Poe,” Gautier
writes, “did not equal in delicacy of induction
and clearness of detail his feverish recital of
the proposed expedition by which we were to
become masters of a treasure far richer than
Kidd’s.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sandeau</span> was as easily seduced as myself.
It was necessary that Balzac should have two
robust and devoted accomplices, and, in exchange
for our assistance, he was good enough
to offer to each of us a quarter of the prodigious
fortune. Half was to be his, by right of
conquest. It was arranged that we were to
purchase spades and picks, place them secretly
in a ship, and, to avoid suspicion, reach the
designated spot by different roads, and then,
after having disinterred the treasure, we were
to embark with it on a brig freighted in advance.
In short, it was a real romance, which
would have been admirable had it been written
instead of recited. It is of course unnecessary
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
to add that the booty was not unearthed. We
discovered that we had no money to pay our
traveling expenses, and our united capital was
insufficient to purchase even the spades.”</p>

<p class='c011' >At another time Balzac conceived the project
of manufacturing paper from a substance which
was at once cheap and plentiful. Experiments,
however, proved that his plan was impracticable,
and a friend who called to console him
found that, instead of being dejected, he was
even more jovial than ever.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Never mind about the paper,” he said. “I
have a better scheme yet.”</p>

<p class='c011' >It was this: While reading Tacitus, he had
stumbled upon a reference to the mines of Sardinia;
his imagination, aided by his scientific
knowledge, carried him back to the imperfect
mechanical processes of old Rome, and he saw
at once a vision of wealth, awaiting only modern
appliances to be his own. With the greatest
difficulty he collected—partly from his mother,
partly from his cousin, and partly from that
aunt whom the Anglo-Saxon Bohemian has
converted into an uncle—the sum of five hundred
francs; and then, having reached Genoa,
he embarked for Alghiero, explaining his project
to the captain of the vessel with the candor
of an infant.</p>

<p class='c011' >Once in Sardinia, dressed like a beggar,—a
terror to brigands and monks,—he sought the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
mines on foot. They were easily found. With
a few specimens of the ore, he returned immediately
to Paris, where an analysis showed
them to contain a large proportion of silver.
Jubilant with success, he would then have applied
to the Italian government for a concession
of the mines, but unfortunately he was, for
the moment, detained by lawsuits and other
business, and when he at last set out for Milan
it was too late. The perfidious captain had
thought the idea so good that, without preliminary
examinations, he had lost no time in securing
an authorization in due form, and was
then quietly proceeding to make a fortune.</p>

<p class='c011' >“There is a million in the mines,” Balzac
wrote to his sister. “A Marseilles firm has assayed
the scoriæ, but the delay has been fatal.
The Genoese captain has already obtained a
contract from the government. However, I
have another idea, which is even better; this
time there will be no Genoese. I am already
consoled.”</p>

<p class='c011' >After having read “Venice Preserved” and
admired the union of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jaffier,</span> Balzac
says that he began to consider the peculiar
virtues of those who are thrown outside of the
social order,—the honesty of the galleys, the
fidelity of robbers, and the privileges of that
enormous power which these men obtain in
fusing all ideas into one supreme will,—and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
concluded that, man being greater than men,
society should belong entirely to those whose
brilliancy, intelligence, and wealth could be
joined in a fanaticism warm enough to melt
their different forces into a single jet. An
occult power of this description, he argued,
would be the master of society; it would reverse
obstacles, enchain desires, and give to
one the superhuman power of all; it would be
a world within a world, admitting none of its
ideas, recognizing none of its laws; it would
be a league of filibusters in yellow gloves and
dogcarts, who could at all times be ready to
devote themselves in their entirety to any one
among them who should require their united
aid.</p>

<p class='c011' >This novel conception was not only the motif
of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire des Treize,</span>” but no sooner
was the book completed than Balzac, in accordance
with his mania for living his characters, attempted
to reproduce it in real life,—or rather,
in the other life, for his true world was the one
which he carried in his brain,—and without
difficulty recruited for this purpose <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jules Sandeau,
Léon Gozlan, Laurent Jan, Gérard de
Nerval, Merle, Alphonse Karr,</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Granier de
Cassagnac.</span></p>

<p class='c011' >The aim of the association, which he explained
with that tumultuous eloquence for
which he was famous and which silenced every
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
objection, was simply to grasp the leading-strings
of the principal newspapers, invade the
theatres, take seats in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Académie,</span> and become
millionaires and peers of France. When
any one of them produced a book or a play,
the others were to write about it, talk about it,
and advertise it generally, until its success was
assured; and as nothing succeeds like success,
a good commencement was all that was
needed to insure an easy and glorious ascent.</p>

<p class='c011' >The project was enthusiastically received and
unanimously approved. The society was entitled
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cheval Rouge,</span>” and Balzac was
elected chief.</p>

<p class='c011' >In order to avoid suspicion, it was agreed
that in public the members should not appear
to know each other, and Karr relates that for
a long time Balzac would pretend, whenever he
saw him, that they met for the first time, and
would communicate with him only in an actor’s
aside. The meetings of the society were pre-arranged
by the chief. The notices consisted
of a card, on which was painted a red horse,
and the words, stable, such a day, such a
place; in order to make it still more fantastic,
the place was changed each time.</p>

<p class='c011' >This project, which of course resulted in
nothing, and which was soon abandoned, was
none the less practicable, and minus the mysterious
farce with which it was surrounded has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
since, in many instances, been put into successful
operation.</p>

<p class='c011' >Through one of those psychical phenomena
which generate within us a diversity of sentiment
while uniting their contradictory elements,
Balzac was tortured by a combined distaste
and affection for journalism. It possessed
a morbid attraction for him; and while he execrated
the entire profession, he longed none the
less for an editor’s chair, from which he could
bombard his enemies at his ease, and glean
at the same time the rich harvest which a successful
review invariably produces.</p>

<p class='c011' >The foundation of a journal, however, is
money, more money, always money; and Balzac,
who was rich only in unrecognized audacity
and unquoted talent, after having tried in
every way to acquire the necessary capital, was
about to abandon his scheme as hopeless, when
Providence in the form of a young man passed
the sentries and entered his room.</p>

<p class='c011' >“M. de Balzac?”</p>

<p class='c011' >And Balzac, to whom every stranger was a
dun, replied, “It is, sir, and it is not; it depends.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“I am looking for the author of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Peau de
Chagrin.</span>’”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Ah! then, I am he.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Sir,” said the youth, “I understand that
you are about to edit a journal, and I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
come to ask for the position of theatrical critic.
I would also like to write the fashion article.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac, furious at the intrusion and indignant
at the youth’s proposition to collaborate
in a journal whose appearance was prevented
by lack of funds, was about to order the young
man out, when he suddenly noticed that he was
clothed in the most expensive manner.</p>

<p class='c011' >“May I ask whom I have the honor of addressing?”
inquired the ogre, with his most seductive
smile.</p>

<p class='c011' >“I am the son of M. Chose, the banker.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac became very fascinating. “I thought
so,—I thought so from the first; you look like
him. Will you not sit down? As we were
saying, I am about to edit the ‘Chronique de
Paris,’ whose appearance, so impatiently awaited,
I have delayed only that its success might
be the better assured. And did I understand
you to say that you would like to take charge
of the theatrical criticisms?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Yes, indeed, sir, if you think me capable.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Capable? Do I think you capable? Why,
all the more capable, as it is unusual for a
banker’s son to wish to enter a purely literary
association. The blood of a financier is seldom
inclined to”...</p>

<p class='c011' >“I do not care for letters of credit, M. de
Balzac. I care for <em>letters</em>, simply.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Adorable witticism!” cried Balzac, illuminated
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
with hope. “And you care, then, for literature,
in spite of the immense fortune which
you enjoy?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“I expect ten millions more,” interrupted
the youth.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Ten millions!”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Rather more than less, M. de Balzac.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Nothing could be better or more opportune,”
smiled this courtesan of wealth, reduced
to adulating an idiot. “I was just wondering
whom I should select. The position is yours.
No, no; it is for me to thank you. My best
regards to your dear father.”</p>

<p class='c011' >The youth had barely turned the corner
when Balzac hastily summoned the members
of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cheval Rouge.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011' >“At last I have a capitalist!” he cried. “He
has promised nothing, it is true, but I have reason
to believe that, properly managed, he will
invest anywhere from a hundred thousand up.
He is an idiot, the son of Chose the banker.
He wants to be dramatic critic, and that means
money, simply money, and lots of it. But,” he
continued, “the affair cannot be arranged without
a subtle preparation and solemn initiation,
and preparation and initiation mean <em>dinner</em>.
It is at a dinner, not frugal but sumptuous,
adorned with a garland of editors and critics,
each more seductive than the other, that the
alliance of your intelligence and the money of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
my imbecile will be consummated; and then,
with the champagne in his throat, he will tell
us how much he proposes to pour into the till
of the ‘Chronique de Paris.’ It has not got
one yet, to be sure, but we will buy one as soon
as he furnishes the money.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“But there will be about twenty of us,” objected
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Nerval,</span> “and the dinner will cost at
least four hundred francs. Where are they?
Have you got them?”</p>

<p class='c011' >“No, but I will find them,” Balzac answered,
with a magnificent gesture. “It is not a question
of a dinner in a restaurant, for that would
smack of the adventurer a mile away; and besides,
there of course you pay cash. The banquet
shall be served here, and on credit. We
have only to inspire some caterer with sufficient
confidence.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Charming,” said Merle, as he looked about
the poorly furnished apartment; “but how is
that sufficiency of confidence to be inspired?”</p>

<p class='c011' >After innumerable propositions had been
discussed and rejected, Balzac discovered that
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Granier de Cassagnac</span> had a service of silver
in pawn for eight hundred francs, and prevailed
on Gautier to borrow a like amount, disengage
the silver, which, negligently exposed
on Balzac’s table, would inspire confidence in
any caterer; promising that after the dinner
the silver should be immediately repawned and
the loan repaid.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
“My plan is triumphant!” he exclaimed;
“the money is ours. To-morrow we will liberate
the silver. Tuesday, conference with the caterer.
Wednesday, invitation on vellum launched at
our young capitalist; the same evening, solemn
engagement on his part to invest, accompanied
on ours by the most hilarious toasts. Thursday,
contract drawn by a notary and signed by
the delicate hand of our millionaire. Friday,
reunion and tea, to read over the prospectus,
which I will compose. Saturday, colossal advertisement
on every wall, monument, and column;
and the week after, brilliant apparition on
the Parisian horizon of the first number. Soldiers!
to arms!”</p>

<p class='c011' >This programme, joyously arranged, was fearlessly
carried out. The silver was liberated,
the caterer inspired with confidence, the invitation
accepted, and after a sumptuous repast
Balzac, glass in hand, arose and addressed the
company as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Gentlemen, you are all aware of the object
for which we have assembled this evening
about the liberal and gracious guest here
seated at my right. It is the creation of a publication
destined to assume, thanks to him and
to his munificent intelligence, an unexceptionable
position among the reviews of the century.
Although I have not, to my great regret, been
possessed of sufficient leisure to cultivate as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
I should have desired this rare intelligence,
which has been called not only to fecundate
our own, but also to assist us in spreading the
fruits of our genius over a world which awaits
them, and which, I may confidently state, would
never know them save for the generous and
effective assistance of our guest, I may nevertheless
be permitted to say to what extent he
has, in momentary confidences, permitted me
to foresee treasuries of encouragement and
rich rewards. I do not fear, therefore, to say
that the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chronique de Paris</span>’ will owe to him
its existence, its splendor, and its popularity.
Were my emotion not so great and so real, I
would speak at greater length of the future of
our cherished and illustrious publication; but
I prefer, in begging you, in honor of our guest,
to join your toasts to mine, to leave the floor
to him, that he may explain what in his generosity
he proposes to do for the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chronique
de Paris,</span>’ at once happy and proud to possess
him as protector and patron.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Then, lowering his voice to one of simple politeness,
Balzac turned to his guest, and said,
“Be good enough, my dear young friend, to
explain what your liberal intentions are.”</p>

<p class='c011' >“Gentlemen,” the banker’s son replied, “I
will talk it over with papa.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac grew white as the table-cloth, but,
magnificent in his defeat, hardly had the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
pseudo-capitalist disappeared than he exclaimed,
with an accent which might have unsettled destiny
itself, “It is daylight; let us repawn the
silver!”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011' >Partly for the sake of solitude, and partly to
affect, for business purposes, an appearance
of luxury, Balzac, in 1837, built a villa at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ville
d’Avray,</span> which he named <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Jardies,</span> as a
reminiscence of the days when Louis XIV.
lounged at Versailles.</p>

<p class='c011' >It consisted of but three rooms, or rather
three stories. The ground floor, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rez-de-chaussée</span></i>,
was the reception-room, the second
the study, and the third the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c011' >When the architect’s plan was first submitted,
the staircase greatly interfered with the
dimensions of the rooms, and Balzac, exasperated
at this impertinence, ordered it out of the
house, and caused it, by way of punishment,
to climb in spiral solitude about the outer
wall.</p>

<p class='c011' >This little eccentricity gave to his parrot’s
cage the appearance of having been transplanted
from some old Hanseatic or Flemish
town, and satisfied at the same time his proprietary
pride.</p>

<p class='c011' >At a little distance was another habitation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
in which the kitchen and servants’ rooms were
situated; and the whole establishment was surrounded
by a high wall, which, being built on
the incline of a hillock, was devastated by
every storm, and fell five times into his neighbor’s
grounds; until Balzac, wearied by constant
summons and complaints, bought the
surrounding property, that his cherished wall
might lie at ease where it chose.</p>

<p class='c011' >The interior of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Jardies</span> was fully in keeping
with the character of its owner. The reception-room
was but scantily furnished, and
the bare walls were ornamented with a promise
of Gobelin tapestry traced in charcoal.</p>

<p class='c011' >On the ceiling was written, “Fresco by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Delacroix.</span>”
On the wall of his study he wrote,
“Here is a regal Venetian mirror,” while a corner
of his bedroom assured the visitor that he
was looking at one of Raphael’s priceless Madonnas.</p>

<p class='c011' >In this way Balzac furnished his home with
magnificent dreams, while he dined, perhaps,
as did that creation of Dickens, who cut his
bread into imaginary omelets, and sliced it into
tenderloins.</p>

<p class='c011' >Before Balzac’s advent, the plot of ground
on which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Jardies</span> was built had been a
vineyard, on which the warm sun had lain all
day, and ripened the clustering grapes. The
knowledge of this fact preoccupied him greatly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
If grapes had grown there, he argued, why
should not anything else? Why should not
pine-apples?</p>

<p class='c011' >Now pine-apples were dear in Paris, costing
from ten to fifteen francs apiece; and no
sooner did this idea present itself than it was
grappled, seized, and caressed by Balzac, who
immediately saw an annual harvest of an hundred
thousand pine-apples, which had bloomed
in hot-houses as yet unbuilt.</p>

<p class='c011' >These pine-apples would, he thought, sell at
least for five francs apiece; the attendant expenses
could not be over a hundred thousand
francs; and by a simple mathematical process,
with which no one was more familiar, he foresaw
a princely revenue of four hundred thousand
francs more.</p>

<p class='c011' >These four hundred thousand francs danced
with such charm and grace before him that he
lost no time in looking for a shop in which to
sell his unplanted fruit. He soon found a suitable
one on the Boulevard Montmartre, which
he would have immediately hired, painted in
black and yellow, and decorated with an enormous
sign, bearing for epigraph Pine-apples
from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Jardies,</span> had he not been forcibly dissuaded
by friends less enthusiastic than he.</p>

<p class='c011' >In this way scheme succeeded scheme, and
one project was abandoned only for another.
His latest idea he always considered his best,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
unless he was agreed with, when he would reverse
all his arguments to prove that a precedent
one was better still. At one time he
thought that through a mathematical combination
he had discovered a system which would
enable him to break the bank at Baden; at another
he proposed to cut down a forest in Poland,
and supply Paris with timber, and would
have done so had not his brother-in-law proved
to him that the expenses for transportation
would far exceed any possible profit.</p>

<p class='c011' >To make money, to become a millionaire, and
to lead the life of a prince was his constant aim
and ambition.</p>

<p class='c011' >“The life of an artist,” he said, “should be
a succession of splendors;” and while he detested
Dumas, he secretly admired his Oriental
magnificence and envied his prodigal luxury.
But while the firm of Dumas and Company
was manufacturing novels by the dozen, Balzac
was engaged in weighing a phrase and occupied
with its corrections; while Dumas never
so much as glanced at the proof-sheets of his
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuilletons,</span> Balzac’s were not only carefully
corrected, but the attendant expenses were, by
agreement, charged to him; and where, as in
the case of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierrette,</span>” he was obliged to pay
for the corrections three hundred francs more
than he received for the story itself, it will be
readily understood that the amounts which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
earned by his pen were not always as satisfactory
as could have been desired.</p>

<p class='c011' >In this respect, however, it should be stated
that while the money which he earned in his
later years was out of all proportion to that
which he at first received, yet, in the mean
time, some few debts had necessarily accumulated,
and his income, consequently reduced,
averaged at best not more than ten or twelve
thousand francs.</p>

<p class='c011' >The history of his financial troubles, and of
that which he laughingly termed his floating
debt, can best be found in his correspondence,
which, ranging from his twentieth year to but a
few days prior to his death, contains many details
of the thirty years’ war which he waged
with poverty; and his letters, while interesting
in their account of his transient successes, attendant
struggles, defeats, and final victory,
will convince even the prejudiced reader, that
the writer was, in the first place, a man of the
strictest integrity; for it may be said, without
exaggeration, that the better part of his life
was passed in attempting to satisfy that necessity
whose earthly representatives are creditors;
secondly, that his morals were perfectly
pure, for he loved and reverenced women with
that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">amor intellectualis</span></i> which made chastity to
him one of those graces which are superfluities
to the vulgar and necessities to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
re-fined; and thirdly, that his heart, which was
as great as his brain, was yet too full of affection,
for those whom he loved to harbor malice
against his detractors and persecutors.</p>

<p class='c011' >The earliest of these letters, the majority of
which are addressed to his sister, or to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Zulma Carraud,</span> one of her intimate friends, are
mere descriptions of his life and poverty, and
are expressed with the smiling indifference of
youth, to whom the shadows of the future are
yet vague and distant.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Since you are so much interested in all
that I do,” he wrote from Paris to his sister, in
1819, “you must know that last night I slept
magnificently; and how could I do otherwise?
I dreamed of you, of mother, of my loves, of
my hopes, and now, on awakening, I give you
my earliest thoughts. I must tell you, in the
first place, that that wretch, Myself, becomes
more and more negligent. He goes but twice
a week for provisions, and then, being economical
even of his steps, always to the nearest,
and consequently to the worst, shops in the
neighborhood; hence, your brother, destined
to such celebrity, is already nourished like any
other great man, which means that he is dying
of hunger.”</p>

<p class='c011' >To his sister, in the following year, he
wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I feel to-day that wealth does not constitute
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
happiness, and that my life here will be
to me always a source of the sweetest remembrances.
To live as I choose; to work when
I will, and after my own manner; to do nothing,
even, if I so desire; to fall asleep in a
beautiful future; to think of you, and to know
that you are happy; to possess the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Julie</span> of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rousseau</span> for mistress, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Fontaine</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Molière</span>
for friends, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Racine</span> for master, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père-Lachaise</span>
for promenade!... Oh, could it but
last forever!”</p>

<p class='c011' >And a little later,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I have just returned from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père-Lachaise,</span>
where I have been inhaling magnificent inspirations.
Decidedly, the only beautiful epitaphs
are such as these, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>La Fontaine</i>, <i>Molière</i>,
<i>Masséna</i>,</span>—a single name which tells all, and
makes the passer dream!”...</p>

<p class='c011' >The next year he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“<span class='sc'>Dear Sister</span>,—I am going to work like
the horse of Henri IV. before it was cast in
bronze; and this year I hope to make the
twenty thousand francs which are to commence
my fortune. I have a quantity of novels and
dramas to prepare.... In a little while there
will be, between the me of to-day and the me
of to-morrow, the difference that exists between
the boy of twenty and the man of thirty.
I reflect; my ideas ripen; and I see that in giving
to me the heart and head which I possess
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
Nature has treated me with favor. Believe in
me, dear sister; for while I do not despair of
being something, some day, I yet have need
of a believer. I see now that ‘Cromwell’
had not even the merit of an embryo. As to
my novels, they are as poor as the devil,
though not half so seductive.”</p>

<p class='c011' >But when, later on, at the age of twenty-seven,
Balzac found himself without position,
without a profession, entirely unknown, without
resources, and burdened, moreover, with
a debt of 120,000 francs,—the result of his
disastrous experience as printer and publisher,—he
had but his pen with which to conquer
poverty and combat the world. His family
had no faith in him; they had sunk a large
sum in his enterprise; he was friendless, and
his genius was entirely unrecognized; and it
is at once curious and pathetic to note through
the rest of his correspondence the continued
recurrence and repetition of his dream of prospective
fortune and freedom from debt.</p>

<p class='c011' >His first letters after his disaster are profoundly
sad: in one he wrote to his sister,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I must live without asking aid of any one.
I must live to work, that I may repay you all;
but shall I be able to live long enough to pay
my debts of love and gratitude as well?”</p>

<p class='c011' >To the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse d’Abrantès,</span> in the same
year, he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
“I wonder if you have ever experienced the
extent to which misfortunes develop within
us the terrible faculty of breasting a tempest,
and of opposing to adversity an immobile calm.</p>

<p class='c011' >“As for myself, I have acquired the habit of
smiling at the torments of fate,—torments that
still continue.</p>

<p class='c011' >“I am old in suffering, but my light-hearted
appearance offers no criterion of my age. I
have never been otherwise; I have been always
bent beneath a terrible weight. Nothing
can give you an idea of the life which I have
led, nor of my astonishment at having nothing
but fortune to combat.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Were you to inquire about me, you would
be unable to obtain any insight to the nature
of my misfortunes; but then you know there are
those who die without any apparent disease....</p>

<p class='c011' >“I have undertaken two books at a time, to
say nothing of a number of articles. The days
evaporate in my hands like ice in the sunlight.
I do not live; I waste away; but death from
work or from any other cause amounts to the
same thing in the end.... I sleep from six in
the evening until midnight, and then I work
for sixteen hours. I have but one hour of liberty,
and that during dinner. I have sworn to
owe nothing, and though I die like a dog my
courage will support me to the end.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In 1831, he wrote to the same lady,—</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
“You do not know that in 1828 I had but
my pen with which to live and pay off 120,000
francs. In a few months I shall be free from
debt, and be able to arrange a comfortable
home. During the next six months, therefore,
I shall enjoy my last miseries. I have asked
aid from no one. I have never stretched my
hand, either for a page or a sou. I have hidden
my griefs and my wounds, and you who
know how difficult it is to make money with the
pen will, with your feminine glance, be able to
sound the depths of the abyss which I disclose
to you, and by the side of which I have marched
without falling.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In the following year, he wrote to his mother,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Sooner or later, literature, politics, journalism,
marriage, or some good speculation will
make my fortune.”</p>

<p class='c011' >And later on,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Thank you, my sister; you have restored to
me that energy which has been my sole support.
Yes, you are right. I will not stop; I will continue
to advance, and some day you will see
mine counted among the great names of our
country.... My books are the only replies
which I shall make to those who commence to
attack me. Do not let their criticisms annoy
you: they are the best of auguries; mediocrity
is never discussed. Tell my mother that I love
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
her as I did when a child. The tears fall from
my eyes as I write these lines,—tears of tenderness
and of despair, for I feel my future near
at hand, and in my days of triumph my mother
will be a necessity. When will they come?
As to you and to your husband, I can only hope
that you will never doubt my heart, and if I do
not write to you let your tenderness be indulgent.
Do not misjudge my silence, but say,
rather, ‘He thinks of us, he is speaking to us;’
for, after my long meditations and overwhelming
duties, I rest in your hearts as in some
delicious spot where there is no pain.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In the same year, from Aix, he wrote to his
mother,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I shall not return to Paris until all my engagements
are fulfilled; when I do so everything
will have been paid off.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In 1833, to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Carraud,</span>—</p>

<p class='c011' >“My life is mechanically changed. I go to
sleep with the chickens and am called at one in
the morning. I then work until eight o’clock,
sleep for an hour, and at nine I take a cup of
pure coffee, and remain in harness until four. I
then take a bath, and go out, and after dinner
return to bed. Profit is slow, and debts are
inexorable, but I am certain now of immense
wealth. I have but to wait and work for three
years.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In the following year, he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
“The fiascos of the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médecin de Campagne</span>’
and ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis Lambert</span>’ have affected me deeply,
but I am resolved that nothing shall discourage
me. After the 1st of August I think that I
shall be free.”</p>

<p class='c011' >And later on, in the same year,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“If I but live, I shall have a beautiful position,
and we will all be happy. Let us laugh
then still, my sweet sister; the house of Balzac
will triumph yet.”</p>

<p class='c011' >To his mother he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“The day when we shall all be happy rapidly
approaches. I begin to gather the fruit
of the sacrifices which I made for the sake
of future prosperity. In a few months I will
bring to you the ease and comfort which you
need.... Oh, my dear mother, you will yet
live to see my beautiful future; for, in the end,
everything must bend beneath the work of him
who loves you, and is your devoted son.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In 1835 he wrote to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Werdet,</span> his publisher,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Some day,—and that day rapidly advances,—we
shall both have made our fortune; and
the sight of our carriages meeting in the Bois
will make our enemies swoon with envy.”</p>

<p class='c011' >To his mother, in the same year, he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Do not be vexed at my silence. I not only
have a great deal to do, but I work twenty-one
hours and a half daily. A letter is not
only a loss of money, but an hour’s sleep and
a drop of blood.”</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
To <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Hanska</span> he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“That you may know the extent of my courage,
I must tell you that the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secret des Ruggieri</span>’
was written in one night, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vieille
Fille</span>’ in three, and ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Perle Brisée,</span>’ which
terminates ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Enfant Maudit,</span>’ was composed
in a few hours of mental and physical agony.
It is my <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brienne,</span> my <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champaubert,</span> my <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmirail.</span>
It is my campaign in France.”</p>

<p class='c011' >And to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Carraud,</span>—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I sleep but five hours, and work eighteen.
I shall purchase the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grenadière,</span><a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and pay my
debts. I need at least a year to be completely
free from debt, but the happiness of owing nothing,
which I thought impossible, is no longer a
chimera.”</p>

<p class='c011' >In October, 1836, he wrote to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Hanska,</span>—</p>

<p class='c011' >“You do not know the depths of my grief,
nor the sombre courage which accompanies
the second great defeat which I have experienced.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
The first occurred when I was barely
twenty-nine; and then I had an angel at my
side.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> To-day I am too old to inspire a sentiment
of inoffensive protection.... I am overcome,
but not conquered. My courage yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
remains.... During the past month, I have
worked from midnight until six in the evening;
and while I have observed the strictest diet,
that my brain might not be troubled by the
fatigue of digestion, nevertheless, I not only
suffer from indescribable weaknesses, but I also
experience nervous attacks of the most singular
character. I sometimes lose the sense of
verticality, and even in bed it seems as though
my head fell to the right or to the left; and
when I attempt to get up I am as though
weighed down by an enormous burden, which
seems to be in my brain. I understand now
how Pascal’s absolute continence and excessive
brain work caused him continually to see
an abyss about him, and obliged him to sit
between two chairs.... But if I do not succumb
in the mean time, two years of work will
suffice for the payment of everything.”</p>

<p class='c011' >To the same lady, two years later, he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I am thirty-nine years old, and I owe two
hundred thousand francs. Belgium has stolen
a million from me.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011' >In 1838 he wrote to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Carraud,</span>—</p>

<p class='c011' >“I have greater faith than ever in my work.
I have been offered twenty thousand francs for
a play. Hereafter, I shall devote my time to
the theatre; books no longer pay.... You
have no idea how happy I shall be in a few
years. My gains will be enormous.”</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
A few months later he wrote,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“My debts and money troubles are the
same as ever, but my courage has redoubled
with the decrease of my desires.... I hope
to remain here<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> for three or four months, and
then, if my plays succeed, it may be that over
and above my debts I shall have gained sufficient
capital to supply my daily bread, my
flowers, and my fruits. The rest, perhaps, will
come with time.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Continually overthrown, but never conquered,
in his letters during the next eight years he
seems to breathe the delicious idea of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Custine,</span>
that hope is the imagination of those
who are unhappy. In May, 1846, however, he
wrote to his sister,—</p>

<p class='c011' >“A series of terrible and unbelievable disasters
have happened to me. I am entirely
without money, and am being sued by those
who were friendly to me.... I shall have to
work eighteen hours a day.”</p>

<p class='c011' >These terrible and unbelievable disasters
were the result of a debt of ten thousand francs,
which he owed to William Duckett, the editor
of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de la Conversation,</span>” who,
being in difficulties himself, was obliged not
only to sue Balzac, but to obtain an order for his
arrest. Balzac, however, was not to be found.
No trace of him was to be had at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passy,</span> nor at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
any of his several habitations, which, though
secret to the world at large, were necessarily
known to the police. One day, however, a woman,
whose advances to Balzac had not been
met with that degree of cordiality which she
had doubtless expected, called upon Duckett,
and told him that Balzac was to be found at
the residence of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Visconti,</span> on the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées.</span></p>

<p class='c011' >In an hour the house was surrounded, and
Balzac, interrupted in the middle of a chapter,
was informed that a cab awaited him at the
door. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Visconti,</span> with a hospitality
which was simply royal, asked the amount of
the debt, and paid the ten thousand francs on
the spot. A few days later Balzac wrote to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Hanska,</span>—</p>

<p class='c011' >“You can form no idea of the life of a hunted
hare which I have led. Two years of calm and
tranquillity are absolutely necessary to soothe
my spirit, worn by sixteen years of successive
catastrophes. I am tired, very tired, of this
incessant struggle. My last debts are more
irksome than all the others which I have paid.”</p>

<p class='c011' >But now in regard to these debts, to the payment
of which he seems to have devoted his
life, it is only natural to ask in what they consisted
and whence they came: for they became
as famous as Balzac himself; they followed him
about like a glittering retinue, and found their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
way not only into his correspondence, but into
his romances, and supplied him with a subject
of conversation of which he never tired.</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac, as has been seen, wished to be considered
as much of a Monte Cristo as Dumas
himself, and could not, without causing his pen
to blush, permit it to be believed that he did not
extract from his books the same magnificent
harvest which was annually reaped by his rival.
The debt of 120,000 francs which had crippled
his early manhood was, with his habitual probity,
soon wiped out; but the remembrance of
it remained, and this remembrance, joined to
the annoyance caused by a few creditors, suggested
an innocent deceit which would explain
why he did not live in a palace and enjoy the
splendors of a literary monarch. He imagined,
therefore, and caused it to be understood that
he was not only immensely in debt, but that
the sums which he owed were fabulous; and he
talked of them, wrote of them, and increased
them to such an extent that it was not long before
they became even more celebrated than
the prodigalities of his confrère.</p>

<p class='c011' >His debts, however, both real and imaginary,
were finally paid, and their liquidation was the
climax of the solitary romance of his life.</p>

<p class='c011' >About the year 1835, he became acquainted
with the Countess Hanska, a Polish lady, of
great beauty and immense wealth, whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
husband was an invalid. It has been stated—on
what authority it has been difficult to discover—that
when she accidentally met the author of
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine</span>” her emotion was so
great that she lost consciousness. The better
opinion, however, would be that a correspondence,
begun on her side after the publication
of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médecin de Campagne,</span>” a work which
she greatly admired, was continued for a number
of years before they finally met. Balzac
paid several visits to her Polish estates, and it
is probable that she frequently came to Paris.
After her husband’s death marriage was naturally
thought of, but for the time being there
were many obstacles: Balzac’s pecuniary position
was most unfortunate, while she, as a Russian
subject, was not in a position to marry off-hand.</p>

<p class='c011' >The winter of 1848, as well as the spring of
the following year, Balzac passed at Vierzschovnia,
with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Hanska</span> and her children.
He was wretchedly ill, and the physicians had
forbidden any kind of mental labor. Incessant
work and the abuse of coffee had seriously undermined
his constitution and shattered his
nerves of steel, but the day to which he had
looked with such constant expectation had at
last arrived: his debts were not only paid, but
the revenues from the sale of his books were
magnificent.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
For some little time he had been preparing
in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue Fortunée</span>—now <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue Balzac</span>—a
superb residence. His taste in furniture and
works of art found ample expression there.
For one set of Florentine workmanship the
king of Holland himself was in treaty, while
his art gallery was the same as is described in
“Le Cousin Pons.”</p>

<p class='c011' >While he was in Poland his mother was his
general agent, and he wrote to her the most
minute directions of everything appertaining
to the house, its fixtures and decorations; and
finally, on the 17th March, 1850, he wrote from
Vierzschovnia as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Three days ago I married the only woman
whom I have loved, whom I love more than
ever, and whom I shall love until death. I believe
that this union is the recompense that
God has held in reserve for me through so
many adversities, years of work, and difficulties
suffered and overcome. My youth was unhappy
and my spring was flowerless, but I shall have
the most brilliant summer and the sweetest of
autumns.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Balzac had now fulfilled his two immense
desires: he was celebrated, he was beloved.
His own income combined with that which remained
to his wife—she had, at his instance,
made over the greater portion of her fortune
to her children—sufficed for the realization
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
of his most extravagant dreams. “I shall
live to be eighty,” he said. “I will terminate
the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine</span>’ and write dozens of
dramas. I will have two children,—not more;
two look well on the front seat of a landau.”
It was all too beautiful; nothing remained but
death, and five months after his marriage, on
the 20th of August, 1850, after thirty years of
ceaseless toil, at the very moment when the
world was his, Balzac, as a finishing touch to
his own “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études Philosophiques,</span>” died suddenly
of disease of the heart.</p>

<p class='c011' >At his grave in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père-Lachaise</span> is a simple
monument, bearing for epitaph that “single
name which tells all and makes the passer
dream;” and here, at the very spot where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rastignac,</span>
after the burial of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père Goriot,</span> hurled
his supreme defiance at Paris, Victor Hugo
delivered the funeral oration.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Alas!” he said, “this powerful and tireless
worker, this philosopher, this thinker and poet,
whose existence was filled with more labors
than days, passed among us that life of struggles
and combats common in all time to all
great men. To-day, at last, he is at peace: he
has taken leave of contests and hatreds, and
enters now both glory and the tomb. Hereafter
he will shine above all the clouds about
us, high among the stars of our country.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Balzac, to borrow a Hindu expression, was
“an artificer who built like a giant and finished
like a jeweler.” The groundwork of
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Humaine</span>” was grandly conceived
and admirably executed; and though a
few of the balconies of its superb superstructure
are incomplete, yet as, happily, masterpieces
are ever eternally young, it shows no
signs of decay, and there is little danger of its
falling in ruins.</p>

<p class='c011' >For the decoration of this work, Balzac
brought a subtle analysis of men, women, and
things, and adorned it all with brilliant ideas
and profound reflections, of which the saddest
were dug from his own sufferings, and not, as
a great writer has said, from the hearts of his
mistresses.</p>

<p class='c011' >As everything that he wrote is more or less
worthy of attention, a complete collection of
his theories and teachings would be as impossible,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
as an arrangement of Emerson’s best
thoughts, and in any event would ill befit the
unpretentious character of this treatise. For
his elaborate monographs on religion, morality,
society, politics, science, and art, the reader
must turn to the complete edition of his writings;
for in these pages the attempt will be
made to render only a handful of unsorted
aphorisms and reflections, taken at random,
of which the majority will be found to touch
merely upon every-day topics, and that in the
lightest possible vein.</p>

<p class='c011' >With this brief explanation, for which your
indulgence is requested, the crier gives way to
the thinker.</p>

<p class='c014' >A woman is to her husband that which her
husband has made her.</p>

<p class='c011' >It is still a question, both in politics and
marriage, whether empires are overthrown and
happiness destroyed through over-confidence
or through too great severity.</p>

<p class='c011' >A husband risks nothing in affecting to
believe his wife, and in patiently holding his
tongue. Of all things, silence worries a woman
most.</p>

<p class='c011' >It is, perhaps, only those who believe in God
who do good in secret.</p>

<p class='c011' >Statesmen, thinkers, men who have commanded
armies,—in a word, those who are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>

their simplicity places one at once on an equality
with them.</p>

<p class='c011' >Genius is intuition.</p>

either for good or for evil, but that which is imperfect.
His every work, be it intellectual or

<p class='c011' >Dignity is but the screen of pride; from behind
it we rage at our ease.</p>

whom the extremes of happiness and misery
produce a soporific effect.</p>

are acknowledged with the greatest repugnance.</p>

<p class='c011' >To live by the pen is a labor which galley-slaves

To live by the pen consists in creating,—creating

<p class='c011' >A woman who is guided by her head, and not

all the defects of a passionate woman, with none

A woman’s real physiognomy does not begin

<p class='c011' >True love appears in but one of two ways:

When a love-letter is so well written that it
would afford pleasure to any third person who
might read it, it emanates most assuredly from
the brain, and not from the heart.</p>

<p class='c011' >It takes an old woman to read an old woman’s

the same reason that it is more difficult to be

<p class='c011' >A man seldom passes without remorse from

<p class='c011' >When two women could kill each other, and
each sees a poisoned dagger in the other’s

is touching and untroubled until one of them
accidentally drops her weapon.</p>

<p class='c011' >Study is so motherly and good that it is almost
a sin to ask of it other rewards than the
pure and sweet delights with which it nourishes
its children.</p>

<p class='c011' >We must handle many lamps of Aladdin before
we find that the real one is chance, or labor,
or genius.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the life of every woman there is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
moment when she understands her destiny, and in
which her organization, hitherto dumb, speaks
authoritatively. It is not always a man who
wakes this sixth and sleeping sense; it may be
an unexpected spectacle, a landscape, something
she has just read, a religious ceremony, a
concert of natural flowers, the caressing notes
of a strain of music; in a word, some unexpected
movement of the soul or body.</p>

<p class='c011' >However malicious a man may be, he can
never say anything worse of women than they
think of themselves.</p>

<p class='c011' >One may be both a great man and a wicked
one, as one may be a fool and a perfect lover.</p>

<p class='c011' >The ancients were right in their worship of
beauty. Has not some traveler or other told
us that wild horses choose the most beautiful
among them for leader? Beauty is the spirit
of all things. It is the seal which Nature has
placed on her most perfect creations. It is the
truest of symbols, and the one the most rarely
encountered. Who has ever thought of a deformed
angel?</p>

<p class='c011' >We allow others to elevate themselves above
us, but we never forgive those who refuse to
descend to our level.</p>

<p class='c011' >The customs of every class of society are
more or less alike, and differ only in degrees.
High life has a slang of its own, but its slang
is termed “style.”</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
A fact worthy of notice is the extent to which
we make engagements with ourselves, and the
manner in which we create our own lot in life.
Chance has assuredly not so much to do with
it as we think.</p>

<p class='c011' >The weakest of thinking creatures is wounded
in that which is most dear when performing,
at the command of another, that which would
have been done unordered; and the most
odious of all tyrannies is that which continually
divests of intention the merit of its actions and
thoughts. The word which is the easiest to
pronounce and the sentiment which is the sweetest
to express dies within us when we feel that
it is commanded. We abdicate without having
reigned.</p>

<p class='c011' >The art of marriage, as of literature, consists
solely in graceful transitions.</p>

<p class='c011' >Events are never absolute. Their results
depend entirely on the individual. Misfortune
is a stepping-stone to genius, a treasure to the
adroit, but to the weak an abyss.</p>

<p class='c011' >To forget is the great secret of strong and
creative lives,—to forget utterly, after the manner
of Nature, who knows no past, and who
each hour recommences the mysteries of her
indefatigable parturitions. It is the weak who
live with grief, and who, instead of changing it
into apothegms of existence, toy and saturate
themselves therewith, and retrograde each day
to consummated misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
There are incommensurable differences between
the man who mingles with others and
him who dwells with nature. Once captured,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toussaint Louverture</span> died without uttering a
word, while Napoleon, on his rock, chattered
like a magpie; he wished to explain himself.</p>

<p class='c011' >Man has a horror of solitude, and of all solitudes
the purely moral is the most terrible.
The early anchorites lived with God. They
dwelt in the spiritual world, which is the most
populous of all. Misers inhabit a world of
fantasy and delight; for the miser has everything,
even to his sex, in his brain. Man’s first
thought, then, be he leper or galley-slave, is to
find an accomplice to his destiny. To the satisfaction
of this aim, which is life itself, he employs
all his strength and all his power. Without
this sovereign desire, could Satan have
found companions?</p>

<p class='c011' >Solitude is inhabitable only by the man of
genius, who peoples it with ideas, or by the
contemplator of the universe, who sees it illuminated
by the light of heaven and animated
by the voice of God. To others solitude is to
torture as the mind is to the body. It is suffering
multiplied by the infinite.</p>

<p class='c011' >The moral of all things has puddles, from
which the world’s dishonored, as they drown,
throw mud on others.</p>

<p class='c011' >The study of the mysteries of thought, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
discovery of the organs of the soul, the geometry
of the forces, the phenomena of its power,
the appreciation of the faculty which we seem
to possess of moving independently of the
body,—in a word, the laws of its dynamics,
and those of its physical influence will constitute
the coming centuries’ glorious share in
science.</p>

<p class='c011' >We are obliged to accept the ideas of the
poet, the picture of the painter, the statue of the
sculptor; but we all of us interpret music according
to our grief or our happiness, our
hopes or our despair. Where other arts circle
our thoughts, and fix them on a determined object,
music sends them flitting over the expanses
of nature which it has the power to depict.</p>

<p class='c011' >Thought is the key to every treasure. It
brings to us a miser’s joy without his cares.</p>

<p class='c011' >There is not a forest without its significance,
not a high-way nor a by-way which does not
present analogies with the labyrinth of human
thought. What man, whose mind is cultivated
or whose heart has suffered, ever walked in a
forest that the forest did not speak to him?
Insensibly there arises a voice, either consoling
or terrible, and often consoling and terrible.
If the cause of the grave and mysterious sensation
which then seizes him be sought, it will be
found, I think, in the sublime spectacle of creatures
obeying the destinies to which they are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
immutably subjected. Sooner or later an overwhelming
sentiment of the permanence of nature
fills the heart, and the thought turns irresistibly
to God.</p>

<p class='c011' >The more illegal the gain, the greater its
attraction. Such is the heart of man.</p>

<p class='c011' >An out-and-out criminal rarely exists, for
there are few among us who do not permit
themselves one or two good actions, at least.
Be it from curiosity, from pride, for the sake
of contrast, or by accident, every man has had
his moment of kindliness and benevolence.</p>

<p class='c011' >When we condemn a fellow creature in refusing
to him forever our esteem, we have but
ourselves to rely on; and even so, have we the
right to make our hearts a tribunal, and summon
our neighbor there? Where would the
law be, in what would the measure of judgment
consist? That which is our weakness
is perhaps his strength. To so many different
beings so many different circumstances
for each act, for no two occurrences are ever
the same. Society alone has the right to repress
its members. As to punishment, I contest
it; the curb is sufficient, and cruel enough
at that.</p>

<p class='c011' >The genius is he who perpetually impresses
his deeds with his thought.</p>

<p class='c011' >When a man feels that he is destined to
great things, it is difficult for him to conceal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
it. The bushel has always crevices through
which the light must pass.</p>

<p class='c011' >Women of the world have a marvelous talent
for diminishing their faults. They can efface
anything with a smile, a question, or a
feigned surprise. They remember nothing, and
explain everything; they become astonished,
ask questions, criticise, amplify, quarrel, and
wind up by chasing their faults away, as easily
as they would a spot with a bit of soap. You
know them to be black, and in a moment they
have become white and innocent. As for you,
consider yourself lucky if, in the mean time,
they have not found you guilty of some unpardonable
sin.</p>

<p class='c011' >The fortune of a new word is made when it
answers to a class of men or things which otherwise
could not be described without periphrasis.</p>

<p class='c011' >One of the most important rules in the science
of manners is that you preserve an almost
absolute silence concerning yourself.
Play the comedy, some day, of speaking of
your own interests to ordinary acquaintances,
and you will see feigned attention swiftly followed
by indifference, and then by weariness,
until every one has found a pretext for leaving
you. But if you wish to group about you the
sympathies of all, and to be considered a charming
and agreeable fellow, talk to them of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
themselves, seek some way of bringing each into
action in turn; then they will smile at you,
think well of you, and praise you when you
are gone.</p>

<p class='c011' >There is no ease in the gestures of a soulless
woman.</p>

<p class='c011' >Instincts are implacable. If we disobey
them we are punished. There is one in particular
which the animal obeys unhesitatingly:
it is the one which commands us to avoid the
person who has once injured us, whether the
injury was intentional or accidental. The
creature that has harmed us once will be
always harmful: whatever his rank may be,
however nearly he may be related to us, break
with him at once; he is an envoy of our evil
genius.</p>

<p class='c011' >Prudence consists in never threatening; in
facilitating an enemy’s retreat; in not treading,
as the proverb has it, on the serpent’s tail; and
in avoiding, as one would a murder, an injury
to the self-esteem of an inferior. However
damaging to one’s interest an act may be, in
the long run it is overlooked and explained in
a thousand different ways; but wounded pride
bleeds always, and never forgives.</p>

<p class='c011' >When two people are constantly together,
hatred and love grow apace; every moment
brings a new reason for stronger affection or
increased detestation.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
Love and hate are sentiments which feed on
themselves, but of the two hate is the stronger.
Love is limited; its strength comes of life and
prodigality. But hate is like death; it is in one
sense an active abstraction; it subsists above
men and things.</p>

<p class='c011' >To invent is lingering death; to copy is to
live.</p>

<p class='c011' >If men were frank, they would acknowledge
that misfortune has never taken them entirely
unawares, nor without first sending to them
some visible or occult warning. Many have
not understood the meaning of these mysterious
monitions until after the shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c011' >A singular fascination attaches to celebrity,
however acquired, and it would seem that with
women, as formerly with families, the glory of
a crime effaced the shame. As certain families
boast of decapitated ancestors, so does a
pretty woman become more attractive through
the renown of a terrible betrayal. We are
pitiless only to vulgar sentiments and commonplace
adventures.</p>

<p class='c011' >No moralist will deny that the well-bred, yet
corrupt, are much more agreeable than the
strictly exemplary; for, having sins to ransom,
they are very indulgent to the defects of others.
Virtue, on the contrary, considers herself
sufficiently beautiful to dispense with any effort
at being agreeable; and besides, those who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
are really virtuous have all a few slight suspicions
about their position, and, feeling that
they have been duped at the great bazaar of
life, their speech has that bitter savor which
is peculiar to those who affect to be misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c011' >The woman who is deformed, yet whose husband
considers her figure shapely; the woman
who limps, yet whose husband would not have
her otherwise; the woman who is old, and yet
seems young, are the happiest creatures in the
feminine world. The glory of a woman is in
making her defects beloved. To forget that a
woman who limps does not walk as she should
is the effect of momentary fascination, but to
love her because she does so is the deification
of her infirmity. In the gospel of women, this
sentence, I think, should be written: Blessed
are the imperfect, for theirs is the kingdom
of love. Beauty certainly must be a misfortune
to a woman, for its transient charm is
the mainspring of the sentiment which it inspires,
and the beautiful woman is loved on
the same principle that leads a man to marry
an heiress. But the woman who is not dowered
with the fragile advantages which the
children of Adam seek is alone capable of inspiring
that mysterious passion which never
wanes; to her true love is given, and with it
the deathless embrace of the soul. The most
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
celebrated attachments in history were almost
all inspired by women in whom the vulgar
would have found defects,—Cleopatra, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jeanne
de Naples, Diane de Poitiers, Mademoiselle
de la Vallière, Madame de Pompadour;</span> in a
word, the women whom love has rendered
most celebrated were wanting neither in imperfections
nor in infirmities, while the majority of
women whose beauty has been cited as perfect
witnessed an unfortunate termination to their
love affairs. The cause of this apparent contradiction
is to be found in the fact that the
charm of physical beauty is limited, while psychological
attractions possess an infinite power;
and this, it may be noted, is undoubtedly the
moral of the fabulization of the “Thousand
and One Nights.”</p>

<p class='c011' >Suicide appears to me to be the climax of
a moral disorder, as natural death is the climax
of a physical one. Inasmuch, however,
as the moral faculties are subjected to the laws
of volition, should not their cessation coincide
with the manifestations of the intelligence?
It is the thought, therefore, and not the pistol,
that kills. Besides, the fact that an accident
may destroy us at the moment when life is
most enjoyable should absolve the voluntary
termination of an unhappy existence....
Suicide is the effect of a sentiment which may
be termed self-esteem, in contradistinction to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
that of honor. When a man no longer respects
himself and finds himself no longer respected,
when the actuality of existence is at variance
with his hopes, he kills himself, and thereby
offers homage to the world in refusing to remain
before it divested of his virtues or of his
splendors.... Suicide is of three distinct
classes: first, there is the suicide which is but
the crisis of a long illness, and undoubtedly
belongs to pathology; then, there is the suicide
which is caused by despair; and lastly, the
suicide from ratiocination. Of these three, the
first alone is irrevocable. Sometimes the three
classes unite, as in the case of Jean-Jacques
Rousseau.... Suicide was permitted by Epicurus.
It was the finishing touch to his philosophy.
Where there was no enjoyment to the
senses it was right and proper for the animated
being to seek repose in inanimate nature. Man’s
only aim consisting in happiness, or in the hope
of happiness, death became a benefit to him who
suffered, and who suffered hopelessly. He did
not recommend suicide, nor did he blame it;
he was content to say, “Death is not a subject
for laughter, nor is it a subject for tears.”
More moral and more imbued with the sentiment
of duty, Zeno in certain cases forbade
suicide to the stoic. Man, he taught, differs
from the brute in that he disposes sovereignly
of his person; divested of the right of life and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
death over himself, he becomes the slave of
men and events. To man, therefore, freedom
in all things should belong: freedom from passions,
which should be sacrificed to duties;
freedom from fellow creatures in exhibiting
the steel or the poison which disarms attack;
freedom from destiny in setting a limit beyond
which it can have no effect.... Among
the atheists of to-day, the coward alone accepts
a dishonored life.</p>
